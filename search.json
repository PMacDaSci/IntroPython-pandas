    "text": "Prerequisites\nBefore starting this course you will need to ensure that your computer is set up with the required software. If you have any difficulty installing any of this software then please contact one of the trainers for help.\n\nStep 1: Installing Python\nThere are multiple ways you can use Python at Peter Mac. The easiest and most convenient way is to install Python on your own computer. However, if you prefer to avoid the installation process or need additional computational capabilities the alternative option is to use the cluster.\n\nInstall Python on your own computer\nFor new users, we recommend installing Anaconda. Anaconda conveniently installs Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages.\n\n\nWindows\n\nIf you have admin rights, follow Anaconda Navigator Installation. Otherwise, contact the IT Support.\n\n\n\nmacOS\n\nInstall the Anaconda Navigator from the PeterMac Self-Service → Research Applications tab or from the Anaconda Navigator Installation.\n\n\n\nLinux\n\nInstall the Anaconda Navigator from here.\n\n\nIf you are using Anaconda/Conda on your laptop/desktop on the Peter Mac network you may need to provide proxy settings by adding the following proxy servers as shown here\nTo update the .condarc file follow the quick start guide.\n\nIf you are having trouble opening the Anaconda Navigator please follow their troubleshooting page.\nOnce installed, open the anaconda-navigator directly or type the following command in the terminal to open it.\n\nanaconda-navigator\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Anaconda Navigator\n\n\nUseful links:\n\nGetting started with Navigator\nHow to create a Python environment?\nCreating and managing Python environments\nUsing multiple versions of Python with Navigator\nInstalling and managing Python packages\nHow to install and run Pandas from Anaconda Navigator?\nHow to use special characters in username/password for HTTP proxy?\n\n\n\nUse Python on the cluster?\nFollow the quick start guide on this page.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Installing Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\nOnce Python is installed, the next step is to install a preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to start coding with Python. If you are a new user, we suggest using the Jupyter Notebook. Alternatively, if you are accustomed to using R Studio, it can also serve as a platform for Python coding.\n\nInstall Jupyter Notebook on your own computer\n\nOpen Anaconda Navigator and click install Jupyter Notebook.\nLaunch the Jupyter Notebook directly from the Anaconda Navigator or start the notebook server from the command line by typing the following command.\n\n\njupyter notebook \n\n\nYou should see the notebook home page open in your web browser.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Jupyter Notebook\n\n\n\nTo install Jupyter Notebook, see Installing Jupyter Notebook.\n\nUseful links:\n\nJupyter Notebook Documentation\nHow to use Jupyter Notebooks - DataCamp\nJupyter Notebook: An Introduction\n\n\n\n\nUse Jupyter Notebook on Open OnDemand\nFollow the guide on this page.\nUseful links:\n\nUsing Jupyter on the cluster\nHow to login and use Ope OnDemand\n\n\n\nUse R Studio for Python coding\nThe RStudio IDE is a free and open-source IDE for Python, as well as R. You can write scripts, import modules, and interactively use Python within the RStudio IDE. Whether your intention is to seamlessly combine R and Python or solely concentrate on Python programming, there are several ways you can advance your coding:\n\nRun Python Scripts in the RStudio IDE\nUse R and Python in a single project with the reticulate Package\nUse your Python editor of choice within RStudio tools\n\n\n\nStep 3: Installing a Python library\nIf you are currently using Python using conda (or Anaconda) or if you are using the cluster, a Python library can be installed with Anaconda or Miniconda. For example, to install the pandas and matplotlib libraries of Python use the following command on the terminal.\n\nconda install conda-forge::pandas \nconda install conda-forge::matplotlib \n\nIf you installed Python using Pip, then a Python library can be installed via pip from Python Package Index (PyPI). To install the pandas library of Python use the following command on the terminal.\n\npip install pandas \npip install matplotlib \n\nIf Anaconda Navigator is installed and you prefer to use the Navigator instead of typing commands on a terminal refer to Installing and managing Python packages.\nUseful links:\n\nInstalling conda packages\nInstalling and managing Python packages\nPython Package Index (PyPI)"

    "text": "Building a Basic Plot\nThe construction of ggplot graphics is incremental, allowing for the addition of new elements in layers. This approach grants users extensive flexibility and customization options, enabling the creation of tailored plots to suit specific needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo build a ggplot using plotnine, the following templates can be used for different types of plots. This will be consistently used in subsequent examples.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree things are required for a ggplot:\n\n1. The data\nWe first specify the data frame that contains the relevant data to create a plot. Here we are sending the metabric dataset to the ggplot() function.\n\nimport plotnine\nplotnine.options.figure_size = (6, 4)\nplotnine.options.dpi = 50\n\n\n# render plot background\nggplot(data = metabric).draw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command results in an empty gray panel. We must specify how various columns of the data frame should be depicted in the plot.\n\n\n2. Aesthetics aes()\nNext, we specify the columns in the data we want to map to visual properties (called aesthetics or aes function). e.g. the columns for x values, y values and colours.\nSince we are interested in generating a scatter plot, each point will have an x and a y coordinate. Therefore, we need to specify the x-axis to represent the year and y-axis to represent the count.\n\nggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")).draw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis results in a plot which includes the grid lines, the variables and the scales for x and y axes. However, the plot is empty or lacks data points.\n\n\n3. Geometric Representation geom_()\nFinally, we specify the type of plot (the geom). There are different types of geoms:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n``` - ![](images/geom_blank.png){height=\"63\"} ```{=html}\n``` `geom_blank()` draws an **empty plot**. ```{=html}\n\n\n``` - ![](images/geom_segment.png){height=\"58\"} ```{=html}\n``` `geom_segment()` draws a **straight line**. `geom_vline()` draws a **vertical line** and `geom_hline()` draws a **horizontal line**. ```{=html}\n\n\n``` - ![](images/geom_curve.png){height=\"58\"} ```{=html}\n``` `geom_curve()` draws a **curved line**. ```{=html}\n\n\n``` - ![](images/geom_path.png){height=\"58\"} ```{=html}\n``` `geom_line()/geom_path()` makes a **line plot**. `geom_line()` connects points from left to right and `geom_path()` connects points in the order they appear in the data. ```{=html}\n\n\n\n\n\n``` - ![](images/geom_point.png){height=\"58\"} ```{=html}\n``` `geom_point()` produces a **scatterplot**. ```{=html}\n\n\n``` - ![](images/geom_jitter.png){height=\"58\"} ```{=html}\n``` `geom_jitter()` adds a small amount of **random noise** to the points in a scatter plot. ```{=html}\n\n\n``` - ![](images/geom_dotplot.png){height=\"58\"} ```{=html}\n``` `geom_dotplot()` produces a **dot plot**. ```{=html}\n\n\n``` - ![](images/geom_smooth.png){height=\"58\"} ```{=html}\n``` `geom_smooth()` adds a **smooth trend line to a plot**. ```{=html}\n\n\n``` - ![](images/geom_quantile.png){height=\"58\"} ```{=html}\n``` `geom_quantile()` draws **fitted quantile with lines** (a scatter plot with regressed quantiles). ```{=html}\n\n\n``` - ![](images/geom_density.png){height=\"58\"} ```{=html}\n``` `geom_density()` creates a **density plot**. ```{=html}\n\n\n\n\n\n``` - ![](images/geom_histogram.png){height=\"58\"} ```{=html}\n``` `geom_histogram()` produces a **histogram**. ```{=html}\n\n\n``` - ![](images/geom_bar.png){height=\"58\"} ```{=html}\n``` `geom_bar()` makes a **bar chart**.

The base class method does nothing, geoms can override\n     |      this method for two reasons:\n     |      \n     |      1. The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The ``geom`` inherits from another ``geom`` (superclass) which\n     |         does the drawing and the superclass requires certain aesthetics\n     |         to be present in the data. For example\n     |         :class:`~plotnine.geoms.geom_tile` and\n     |         :class:`~plotnine.geoms.geom_area`.\n     |      \n     |      Parameters\n     |      ----------\n     |      data : dataframe\n     |          Data used for drawing the geom.\n     |      \n     |      Returns\n     |      -------\n     |      out : dataframe\n     |          Data used for drawing the geom.\n     |  \n     |  to_layer(self) -&gt; 'Layer'\n     |      Make a layer that represents this geom\n     |      \n     |      Returns\n     |      -------\n     |      out : layer\n     |          Layer\n     |  \n     |  use_defaults(self, data: 'pd.DataFrame', aes_modifiers: 'dict[str, Any]') -&gt; 'pd.DataFrame'\n     |      Combine data with defaults and set aesthetics from parameters\n     |      \n     |      geoms should not override this method.\n     |      \n     |      Parameters\n     |      ----------\n     |      data : dataframe\n     |          Data used for drawing the geom.\n     |      aes_modifiers : dict\n     |          Aesthetics\n     |      \n     |      Returns\n     |      -------\n     |      out : dataframe\n     |          Data used for drawing the geom.\n     |  \n     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n     |  Class methods inherited from plotnine.geoms.geom.geom:\n     |  \n     |  aesthetics() -&gt; 'set[str]' from plotnine.utils.Registry\n     |      Return all the aesthetics for this geom\n     |      \n     |      geoms should not override this method.\n     |  \n     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n     |  Static methods inherited from plotnine.geoms.geom.geom:\n     |  \n     |  draw_unit(data: 'pd.DataFrame', panel_params: 'panel_view', coord: 'Coord', ax: 'Axes', **params: 'Any')\n     |      Plot data belonging to a unit.\n     |      \n     |      A matplotlib plot function may require that an aethestic\n     |      have a single unique value. e.g. linestyle='dashed' and\n     |      not linestyle=['dashed', 'dotted', ...].\n     |      A single call to such a function can only plot lines with\n     |      the same linestyle.

The base class method does nothing, geoms can override\n     |      this method for two reasons:\n     |      \n     |      1. The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The ``geom`` inherits from another ``geom`` (superclass) which\n     |         does the drawing and the superclass requires certain aesthetics\n     |         to be present in the data. For example\n     |         :class:`~plotnine.geoms.geom_tile` and\n     |         :class:`~plotnine.geoms.geom_area`.\n     |      \n     |      Parameters\n     |      ----------\n     |      data : dataframe\n     |          Data used for drawing the geom.\n     |      \n     |      Returns\n     |      -------\n     |      out : dataframe\n     |          Data used for drawing the geom.\n     |  \n     |  to_layer(self) -&gt; 'Layer'\n     |      Make a layer that represents this geom\n     |      \n     |      Returns\n     |      -------\n     |      out : layer\n     |          Layer\n     |  \n     |  use_defaults(self, data: 'pd.DataFrame', aes_modifiers: 'dict[str, Any]') -&gt; 'pd.DataFrame'\n     |      Combine data with defaults and set aesthetics from parameters\n     |      \n     |      geoms should not override this method.\n     |      \n     |      Parameters\n     |      ----------\n     |      data : dataframe\n     |          Data used for drawing the geom.\n     |      aes_modifiers : dict\n     |          Aesthetics\n     |      \n     |      Returns\n     |      -------\n     |      out : dataframe\n     |          Data used for drawing the geom.\n     |  \n     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n     |  Class methods inherited from plotnine.geoms.geom.geom:\n     |  \n     |  aesthetics() -&gt; 'set[str]' from plotnine.utils.Registry\n     |      Return all the aesthetics for this geom\n     |      \n     |      geoms should not override this method.\n     |  \n     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n     |  Static methods inherited from plotnine.geoms.geom.geom:\n     |  \n     |  draw_unit(data: 'pd.DataFrame', panel_params: 'panel_view', coord: 'Coord', ax: 'Axes', **params: 'Any')\n     |      Plot data belonging to a unit.\n     |      \n     |      A matplotlib plot function may require that an aethestic\n     |      have a single unique value. e.g. linestyle='dashed' and\n     |      not linestyle=['dashed', 'dotted', ...].\n     |      A single call to such a function can only plot lines with\n     |      the same linestyle.

The base class method does nothing, geoms can override\n     |      this method for two reasons:\n     |      \n     |      1. The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The ``geom`` inherits from another ``geom`` (superclass) which\n     |         does the drawing and the superclass requires certain aesthetics\n     |         to be present in the data.

The base class method does nothing, geoms can override\n     |      this method for two reasons:\n     |      \n     |      1. The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The ``geom`` inherits from another ``geom`` (superclass) which\n     |         does the drawing and the superclass requires certain aesthetics\n     |         to be present in the data.

The base class method does nothing, geoms can override\n     |      this method for two reasons:\n     |      \n     |      1. The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The ``geom`` inherits from another ``geom`` (superclass) which\n     |         does the drawing and the superclass requires certain aesthetics\n     |         to be present in the data.

The base class method does nothing, geoms can override\n     |      this method for two reasons:\n     |      \n     |      1. The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The ``geom`` inherits from another ``geom`` (superclass) which\n     |         does the drawing and the superclass requires certain aesthetics\n     |         to be present in the data. For example\n     |         :class:`~plotnine.geoms.geom_tile` and\n     |         :class:`~plotnine.geoms.geom_area`.\n     |      \n     |      Parameters\n     |      ----------\n     |      data : dataframe\n     |          Data used for drawing the geom.\n     |      \n     |      Returns\n     |      -------\n     |      out : dataframe\n     |          Data used for drawing the geom.\n     |  \n     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n     |  Static methods inherited from plotnine.geoms.geom_text.geom_text:\n     |  \n     |  draw_group(data: 'pd.DataFrame', panel_params: 'panel_view', coord: 'Coord', ax: 'Axes', **params: 'Any')\n     |      Plot data belonging to a group.\n     |      \n     |      Parameters\n     |      ----------\n     |      data : dataframe\n     |          Data to be plotted by this geom.

The base class method does nothing, geoms can override\n     |      this method for two reasons:\n     |      \n     |      1. The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The ``geom`` inherits from another ``geom`` (superclass) which\n     |         does the drawing and the superclass requires certain aesthetics\n     |         to be present in the data.

The base class method does nothing, geoms can override\n     |      this method for two reasons:\n     |      \n     |      1. The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The ``geom`` inherits from another ``geom`` (superclass) which\n     |         does the drawing and the superclass requires certain aesthetics\n     |         to be present in the data.

The base class method does nothing, geoms can override\n     |      this method for two reasons:\n     |      \n     |      1. The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The ``geom`` inherits from another ``geom`` (superclass) which\n     |         does the drawing and the superclass requires certain aesthetics\n     |         to be present in the data.

The base class method does nothing, geoms can override\n     |      this method for two reasons:\n     |      \n     |      1. The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The ``geom`` inherits from another ``geom`` (superclass) which\n     |         does the drawing and the superclass requires certain aesthetics\n     |         to be present in the data.

The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The ``geom`` inherits from another ``geom`` (superclass) which\n     |         does the drawing and the superclass requires certain aesthetics\n     |         to be present in the data.

The base class method does nothing, geoms can override\n     |      this method for two reasons:\n     |      \n     |      1. The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The ``geom`` inherits from another ``geom`` (superclass) which\n     |         does the drawing and the superclass requires certain aesthetics\n     |         to be present in the data.

The base class method does nothing, geoms can override\n     |      this method for two reasons:\n     |      \n     |      1. The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The ``geom`` inherits from another ``geom`` (superclass) which\n     |         does the drawing and the superclass requires certain aesthetics\n     |         to be present in the data.

The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The base class method does nothing, geoms can override\n     |      this method for two reasons:\n     |      \n     |      1. The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The ``geom`` inherits from another ``geom`` (superclass) which\n     |         does the drawing and the superclass requires certain aesthetics\n     |         to be present in the data. For example\n     |         :class:`~plotnine.geoms.geom_tile` and\n     |         :class:`~plotnine.geoms.geom_area`.\n     |      \n     |      Parameters\n     |      ----------\n     |      data : dataframe\n     |          Data used for drawing the geom.\n     |      \n     |      Returns\n     |      -------\n     |      out : dataframe\n     |          Data used for drawing the geom.\n     |  \n     |  to_layer(self) -&gt; 'Layer'\n     |      Make a layer that represents this geom\n     |      \n     |      Returns\n     |      -------\n     |      out : layer\n     |          Layer\n     |  \n     |  use_defaults(self, data: 'pd.DataFrame', aes_modifiers: 'dict[str, Any]') -&gt; 'pd.DataFrame'\n     |      Combine data with defaults and set aesthetics from parameters\n     |      \n     |      geoms should not override this method.\n     |      \n     |      Parameters\n     |      ----------\n     |      data : dataframe\n     |          Data used for drawing the geom.\n     |      aes_modifiers : dict\n     |          Aesthetics\n     |      \n     |      Returns\n     |      -------\n     |      out : dataframe\n     |          Data used for drawing the geom.\n     |  \n     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n     |  Class methods inherited from plotnine.geoms.geom.geom:\n     |  \n     |  aesthetics() -&gt; 'set[str]' from plotnine.utils.Registry\n     |      Return all the aesthetics for this geom\n     |      \n     |      geoms should not override this method.\n     |  \n     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n     |  Static methods inherited from plotnine.geoms.geom.geom:\n     |  \n     |  from_stat(stat: 'stat') -&gt; 'geom'\n     |      Return an instantiated geom object\n     |      \n     |      geoms should not override this method.\n     |      \n     |      Parameters\n     |      ----------\n     |      stat : stat\n     |          `stat`\n     |      \n     |      Returns\n     |      -------\n     |      out : geom\n     |          A geom object\n     |      \n     |      Raises\n     |      ------\n     |      PlotnineError\n     |          If unable to create a `geom`.\n     |  \n     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n     |  Data descriptors inherited from plotnine.geoms.geom.geom:\n     |  \n     |  __dict__\n     |      dictionary for instance variables (if defined)\n     |  \n     |  __weakref__\n     |      list of weak references to the object (if defined)\n     |  \n     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n     |  Data and other attributes inherited from plotnine.geoms.geom.geom:\n     |  \n     |  __annotations__ = {'DEFAULT_AES': 'dict[str, Any]', 'DEFAULT_PARAMS': ...\n     |  \n     |  __base__ = &lt;class 'plotnine.geoms.geom_point.geom_point'&gt;\n     |      Plot points (Scatter plot)\n     |      \n     |      \n     |      .. rubric:: Usage\n     |      \n     |      ::\n     |      \n     |          geom_point(mapping=None, data=None, stat='identity', position='identity',\n     |                     na_rm=False, inherit_aes=True, show_legend=None, raster=False,\n     |                     **kwargs)\n     |      \n     |      Only the ``data`` and ``mapping`` can be positional, the rest must\n     |      be keyword arguments. ``**kwargs`` can be aesthetics (or parameters)\n     |      used by the ``stat``.\n     |      \n     |      \n     |      Parameters\n     |      ----------\n     |      mapping : aes, optional\n     |          Aesthetic mappings created with :meth:`~plotnine.aes`.

The base class method does nothing, geoms can override\n     |      this method for two reasons:\n     |      \n     |      1. The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The ``geom`` inherits from another ``geom`` (superclass) which\n     |         does the drawing and the superclass requires certain aesthetics\n     |         to be present in the data.

The base class method does nothing, geoms can override\n     |      this method for two reasons:\n     |      \n     |      1. The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The ``geom`` inherits from another ``geom`` (superclass) which\n     |         does the drawing and the superclass requires certain aesthetics\n     |         to be present in the data.

The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The ``geom`` inherits from another ``geom`` (superclass) which\n     |         does the drawing and the superclass requires certain aesthetics\n     |         to be present in the data.

The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

The ``stat`` does not create all the aesthetics (usually\n     |         position aesthetics) required for drawing the ``geom``,\n     |         but those aesthetics can be computed from the available\n     |         data.

    "text": "Customizing Plots\n\nAdding Colour\nThe above plot could be made more informative. For instance, the additional information regarding the ER status could be incorporated into the plot. To do this, we can utilize aes() and specify which column in the metabric data frame should be represented as the color of the points.\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour = \"ER_status\")) \n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that we specify the colour = ER_status argument in the aes() mapping inside the geom_() function instead of ggplot() function. Aesthetic mappings can be set in both ggplot() and individual geom() layers and we will discuss the difference in the Section: Adding Layers.\nTo colour points based on a continuous variable, for example: Nottingham prognostic index (NPI):\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour = \"Nottingham_prognostic_index\")) \n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, a color scale is used for continuous variables, while discrete or categorical values are represented using discrete colors.\nNote that some patient samples lack expression values, leading ggplot to remove those points with missing values for ESR1 and GATA3.\n\n\nAdding Shape\nLet’s add shape to points.\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\", shape = \"factor(Survival_status)\")) + \n  geom_point()\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome aesthetics like shape can only be used with categorical variables:\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(mapping = aes(shape = \"Survival_time\"))\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\nValueError: Unrecognized marker style 0.0\n\n\nThe shape argument allows you to customize the appearance of all data points by assigning the symbol/letter associated with predefined shapes given here.\nTo use asterix instead of points in the plot:\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(shape = \"*\")\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be useful to be able to change the shape of all the points. We can do so by setting the size to a single value rather than mapping it to one of the variables in the data set - this has to be done outside the aesthetic mappings (i.e. outside the aes() bit) as above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAesthetic Setting vs. Mapping\n\n\n\nInstead of mapping an aesthetic property to a variable, you can set it to a single value by specifying it in the layer parameters (outside aes()). We map an aesthetic to a variable (e.g., aes(shape = \"Survival_status\")) or set it to a constant (e.g., shape = \"*\"). If you want appearance to be governed by a variable in your data frame, put the specification inside aes(); if you want to override the default size or colour, put the value outside of aes().\n\n# size outside aes()\nplot1 = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(shape = \"*\")  \n  )\nplot1.draw()  \n\n# size inside aes()\nplot2 = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(mapping = aes(shape = \"Survival_status\"))\n  )\nplot2.draw()  \n\n\n\n\nThe above plots are created with similar code, but have rather different outputs. The first plot sets the size to a value and the second plot maps (not sets) the size to the three-gene classifier variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is usually preferable to use colours to distinguish between different categories but sometimes colour and shape are used together when we want to show which group a data point belongs to in two different categorical variables.\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = \"factor(PAM50)\", shape = \"Survival_status\"))\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding Size and Transparency\nWe can adjust the size and/or transparency of the points.\nLet’s first increase the size of points.\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = \"PAM50\"), size = 2)\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that here we add the size argument outside of the the aesthetic mapping.\nSize is not usually a good aesthetic to map to a variable and hence is not advised.\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = \"PAM50\", size = \"ER_status\"))\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n/Users/sanduniprasadi/Library/r-miniconda-arm64/envs/r-reticulate/lib/python3.9/site-packages/plotnine/scales/scale_size.py:49: PlotnineWarning: Using size for a discrete variable is not advised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause this value is discrete, the default size scale uses evenly spaced sizes for points categorized on ER status.\nTransparency can be useful when we have a large number of points as we can more easily tell when points are overlaid, but like size, it is not usually mapped to a variable and sits outside the aes().\nLet’s change the transparency of points.\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = \"3-gene_classifier\"), alpha = 0.5)\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding Layers\nWe can add another layer to this plot using a different geometric representation (or geom_ function) we discussed previously.\nLet’s add trend lines to this plot using the geom_smooth() function which provide a summary of the data.\n\nfrom plotnine import geom_smooth\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\"), method=\"lm\")\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n# Method can be one of ['lm', 'ols', 'wls', 'rlm', 'glm', 'gls', 'lowess', 'loess', 'mavg', 'gpr'] by default method is set to lm (linear model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the shaded area surrounding the black line represents the standard error bounds on the fitted model.\nThere is some annoying duplication of code used to create this plot. We’ve repeated the exact same aesthetic mapping for both geoms. We can avoid this by putting the mappings in the ggplot() function instead.\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth()\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeom layers specified earlier in the command are drawn first, preceding subsequent geom layers. The sequence of geom layers specified in the command determines their order of appearance in the plot.\nIf you switch the order of the geom_point() and geom_smooth() functions above, you’ll notice a change in the regression line. Specifically, the regression line will now be plotted underneath the points.\nLet’s make the plot look a bit prettier by reducing the size of the points and making them transparent. We’re not mapping size or alpha to any variables, just setting them to constant values, and we only want these settings to apply to the points, so we set them inside geom_point().\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(size = 1, alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth() \n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAesthetic Specifications in Plot vs. Layers\n\n\n\nAesthetic mappings can be provided either in the initial ggplot() call, in individual layers, or through a combination of both approaches. When there’s only one layer in the plot, the method used to specify aesthetics doesn’t impact the result.\n\n# colour argument inside ggplot()\nplot1 = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\", colour = \"ER_status\")) + \n  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth() \n  )\nplot1.draw()  \n\n# colour argument inside geom_point()\nplot2 = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = \"ER_status\"), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth() \n  )\nplot2.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the left plot, since we specified the colour (i.e., colour = \"ER_status\") inside the ggplot() function, the geom_smooth() function will fit regression lines for each type of ER status and will have coloured regression lines as shown above. This is because, when aesthetic mappings are defined in ggplot(), at the global level, they’re passed down to each of the subsequent geom layers of the plot.\nIf we want to add colour only to the points and fit a regression line across all points, we could specify the colour inside geom_point() function (i.e., right plot).\n\n\nSuppose you’ve spent a bit of time getting your scatter plot just right and decide to add another layer but you’re a bit worried about interfering with the code you so lovingly crafted, you can set the inherit.aes option to False and set the aesthetic mappings explicitly for your new layer.\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\", colour = \"ER_status\")) + \n  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth(aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\"), inherit_aes=False)\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoordinate Space\nggplot automatically selects the scale and type of coordinate space for each axis. The majority of plots utilize Cartesian coordinate space, characterized by linear x and y scales.\n\nfrom plotnine import lims, xlim,ylim, coord_cartesian\n# assign a variable to the plot\ngata_esrp = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour = \"ER_status\"), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth()\n  )\ngata_esrp.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can change the axes limits as follows:\n\n# change both x and y axes\nt1 = gata_esrp + lims(x = (0, 13), y = (0, 14))\nt1.draw()\n\n# change x axis\nt2 = gata_esrp + xlim(5, 9)  \nt2.draw()\n\n# change x axis\nt3 = gata_esrp + ylim(0, 13)\nt3.draw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that we assigned a variable named gata_esrp to our plot and modify it by adding labels. In ggplot, you have the flexibility to assign a variable to plot and then modify it by adding layers to the plot. This approach allows you to progressively build up your visualization, incorporating various elements to convey the desired information effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlims()/xlim()/ylim() vs. coord_cartesian()\n\n\n\nWhen you set the limits using any of the lims()/xlim()/ylim() functions, it discards all data points outside the specified range. Consequently, the regression line is computed across the remaining data points. In contrast, coord_cartesian() adjust limits without discarding the data, thus offering a visual zoom effect.\n\np1 = (gata_esrp + ylim(7, 10))\np1.draw()\n\np2 = (gata_esrp + coord_cartesian(ylim = (7, 10)))\np2.draw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxis Labels\nBy default, ggplot use the column names specified inside the aes() as the axis labels. We can change this using the xlab() and ylab() functions.\n\nfrom plotnine import xlab, ylab\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour = \"ER_status\"), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth() + \n  xlab(\"GATA3 Expression\") + \n  ylab(\"ESR1 Expression\")\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomizing Plots\nYou can customize plots to include a title, a subtitle, a caption or a tag.\nTo add a title:\n\nfrom plotnine import ggtitle\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour = \"ER_status\"), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth() + \n  ggtitle(\"Expression of estrogen receptor alpha against the transcription factor\")\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the labs() function to add a title and additional information.\n\nfrom plotnine import labs\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour = \"ER_status\"), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth() + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Expression of estrogen receptor alpha against the transcription factor\", \n    subtitle = \"ESR1 vs GATA3\", \n    caption = \"This is a caption\", \n    y = \"ESR1 Expression\")\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThemes\nThemes control the overall appearance of the plot, including background color, grid lines, axis labels, and text styles. ggplot offers several built-in themes, and you can also create custom themes to match your preferences or the requirements of your publication. The default theme has a grey background.\n\nfrom plotnine import theme_bw\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour = \"ER_status\"), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth() + \n  theme_bw()\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry these themes yourselves: theme_classic(), theme_dark(), theme_grey() (default), theme_light(), theme_linedraw(), theme_minimal(), theme_void() and theme_test().\n\n\nFacets\nTo enhance readability and clarity, we can break the above plot into sub-plots, called faceting. Facets are commonly used to split a plot into multiple panels based on the values of one or more variables. This can be useful for exploring relationships in the data across different subsets or categories.\nTo do this, we specify the column name that will form each facet.\n\nfrom plotnine import facet_wrap, facet_grid\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour = \"PR_status\"), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth() + \n  facet_wrap(\"PR_status\")\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the aesthetics and geoms including the regression line that were specified for the original plot, are applied to each of the facets.\nFaceting is usually better than displaying groups using different colours when there are more than two or three groups when it can be difficult to really tell which points belong to each group. A case in point is for the three-gene classification in the GATA3 vs ESR1 scatter plot we created above. Let’s create a faceted version of that plot.\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour = \"3-gene_classifier\"), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth() + \n  facet_wrap(\"3-gene_classifier\")\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis helps explain why the function is called facet_wrap(). When it has too many subplots to fit across the page, it wraps around to another row. We can control how many rows or columns to use with the nrow and ncol arguments.\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour = \"3-gene_classifier\"), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth() + \n  facet_wrap(\"3-gene_classifier\", nrow = 1)\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(aes(colour = \"3-gene_classifier\"), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth() + \n  facet_wrap(\"3-gene_classifier\", ncol = 2)\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can combine faceting on one variable with a colour aesthetic for another variable. For example, let’s show the tumour stage status (Neoplasm histologic grade) using faceting and the HER2 status using colours.\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\", colour = \"HER2_status\")) + \n  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + \n  facet_wrap(\"Neoplasm_histologic_grade\")\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of this we could facet on more than variable.\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + \n  facet_wrap([\"Neoplasm_histologic_grade\", \"HER2_status\"])\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFaceting on two variables is usually better done using the other faceting function, **facet_grid(). Note that the variable expressions along the rows and the columns of the facet grid is set using rows= and cols= variables as follows:\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\")) + \n  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + \n  facet_grid([\"Neoplasm_histologic_grade\", \"HER2_status\"])\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain we can use colour aesthetics alongside faceting to add further information to our visualization.\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\", colour = \"PAM50\")) + \n  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) + \n  facet_grid([\"Neoplasm_histologic_grade\", \"HER2_status\"])\n  )\nplot.draw()"

Some of these have been read into Python as character types (e.g. the three gene classifier), other as numerical values (e.g. tumour stage). We also have some binary variables that are essentially categorical variables but with only 2 possible values (e.g. ER status).\nIn many of the plots given above, ggplot has treated character variables as categorical in situations where a categorical variable is expected. For example, when we displayed points on a scatter plot using different colours for each three gene classification, or when we created separate box plots in the same graph for ER positive and negative patients.\nBut what about when our categorical variable has been read into Python as a continuous variable, e.g. Tumour_stage, which is read in as a double type.\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\", colour = \"Tumour_stage\"))\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmetabric.Tumour_stage.unique()\n\narray([ 2.,  1.,  4.,  3., nan,  0.])\n\n\nTumour stage has only 5 discrete states but ggplot doesn’t know these are supposed to be a restricted set of values and has used a colour scale to show them as if they were continuous. We need to tell Python that these are categorical (or factors).\nLet’s convert our tumour stage variable to a factor using the Categorical() function.\n\nmetabric[\"Tumour_stage\"] = pd.Categorical(metabric[\"Tumour_stage\"])\n# or directly convert the type to category\n# metabric[\"Tumour_stage\"] = metabric[\"Tumour_stage\"].astype(\"category\")\nmetabric[[\"Tumour_stage\", \"Patient_ID\"]].head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTumour_stage\nPatient_ID\n\n\n\n\n0\n2.0\nMB-0000\n\n\n1\n1.0\nMB-0002\n\n\n2\n2.0\nMB-0005\n\n\n3\n2.0\nMB-0006\n\n\n4\n2.0\nMB-0008\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPython actually stores categorical variables as integers but with some additional metadata about which of the integer values, or ‘categories’, corresponds to each category.\n\ntype(metabric[\"Tumour_stage\"])\nmetabric[\"Tumour_stage\"].cat.categories\n\nIndex([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], dtype='float64')\n\n\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\", colour = \"Tumour_stage\"))\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case the order of the categories makes sense but for other variables you may wish for more control over the ordering. Take the integrative cluster variable for example. We created a bar plot of the numbers of patients in the Metabric cohort within each integrative cluster. Did you notice the ordering of the clusters? 10 came just after 1 and before 2. That looked a bit odd as we’d have naturally expected it to come last of all.

We can add or reduce the space as follows.\n\nplot = (\n  scat_plot + \n  scale_x_continuous(expand = (0.01, 0)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(expand = (0.25, 0))\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere expand = argument refers to multiplicative and additive expansion constants that determine how the scale is expanded. If specified must be of length 2 or 4. Specifically the values are in this order:\n(mul, add)\n(mul_low, add_low, mul_high, add_high)\nFor example,\n\n(0, 0) : Do not expand.\n(0, 1) : Expand lower and upper limits by 1 unit.\n(1, 0) : Expand lower and upper limits by 100%.\n(0, 0, 0, 0) : Do not expand, as (0, 0).\n(0, 0, 0, 1) : Expand upper limit by 1 unit.\n(0, 1, 0.1, 0) : Expand lower limit by 1 unit and upper limit by 10%.\n(0, 0, 0.1, 2) : Expand upper limit by 10% plus 2 units.\n\nHere we only added 1% (0.01) of the range of NPI values on either side along the x axis but we added 25% (0.25) of the range of ESR1 expression on either side along the y axis.\n\n\nColours\nThe colour asthetic is used with a categorical variable, ER_status, in the scatter plots we’ve been customizing. The default colour scale used by ggplot for categorical variables is scale_colour_discrete. We can manually set the colours we wish to use using scale_colour_manual instead.\n\nfrom plotnine import scale_colour_manual  \nplot = (\n  ggplot(\n    data = metabric, \n    mapping = aes(x = \"Nottingham_prognostic_index\", y = \"ESR1\", colour = \"ER_status\")) + \n  geom_point(size = 0.6, alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") + scale_colour_manual(values = [\"dodgerblue\", \"firebrick\"])\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following figure displays the names of the colors available to use in the scale_colour_manual() function in plotnine. These color names can be directly used to customize the appearance of your plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo view the list of available color names, you can also refer to the matplotlib color documentation, as plotnine uses matplotlib’s color names for setting custom colors in plots.\nSetting colours manually is ok when we only have two or three categories but when we have a larger number it would be handy to be able to choose from a selection of carefully-constructed colour palettes. Helpfully, ggplot provides access to the ColorBrewer palettes through the functions scale_colour_brewer() and scale_fill_brewer().\n\nfrom plotnine import scale_colour_brewer\nscat_plot = (\n  ggplot(\n    data = metabric, \n    mapping = aes(x = \"Nottingham_prognostic_index\", y = \"ESR1\", colour = \"3-gene_classifier\")) + \n  geom_point(size = 0.6, alpha = 0.5, na_rm = True) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") + \n  scale_colour_brewer(type = \"qualitative\", palette = \"Set1\")\n  )\nscat_plot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the help page for scale_colour_brewer to see what other colour palettes are available and visit the ColorBrewer website to see what these look like.\nInterestingly, you can set other attributes other than just the colours at the same time.\n\n# remove legend title for colour now that the labels are self-explanatory\nfrom plotnine import labs\nscat_plot = (\n  ggplot(\n    data = metabric, \n    mapping = aes(x = \"Nottingham_prognostic_index\", y = \"ESR1\", colour = \"ER_status\")) + \n  geom_point(size = 0.6, alpha = 0.5) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") + \n  scale_colour_manual(values = [\"dodgerblue\", \"firebrick\"], labels = [\"ER-negative\", \"ER-positive\"]) + \n  labs(colour = '')\n  )\nscat_plot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have applied our own set of mappings from categories in the data to aesthetic values.\nFor continuous variables we may wish to be able to change the colours used in the colour gradient. To demonstrate this we’ll use the Nottingham prognostic index (NPI) values to colour points in the scatter plot of ESR1 vs GATA3 expression on a continuous scale.\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(\n    data = metabric, \n    mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\", colour = \"Nottingham_prognostic_index\")) + \n  geom_point(size = 0.5, na_rm = True)\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigher NPI scores correspond to worse prognosis and lower chance of 5 year survival. We’ll emphasize those points on the scatter plot by adjusting our colour scale.\n\nfrom plotnine import scale_colour_gradient, scale_colour_gradient2\nplot = (\n  ggplot(\n    data = metabric, \n    mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\", colour = \"Nottingham_prognostic_index\")) + \n  geom_point(size = 0.75, na_rm = True) + \n  scale_colour_gradient(low = \"white\", high = \"firebrick\")\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases it might make sense to specify two colour gradients either side of a mid-point.\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(\n    data = metabric, \n    mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\", colour = \"Nottingham_prognostic_index\")) + \n  geom_point(size = 0.75, na_rm = True) + \n  scale_colour_gradient2(low = \"dodgerblue\", mid = \"#808080\", high = \"firebrick\", midpoint = 4.5)\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs before we can override the default labels and other aspects of the colour scale within the scale function.\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(\n    data = metabric, \n    mapping = aes(x = \"GATA3\", y = \"ESR1\", colour = \"Nottingham_prognostic_index\")) + \n  geom_point(size = 0.75, na_rm = True) + \n  scale_colour_gradient(\n    low = \"lightblue\", high = \"darkblue\", name = \"NPI Values\", \n    breaks = np.arange(2,7), limits = (1.5, 6.5))\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThemes\nThemes can be used to customize non-data components of a plot. Let’s create a plot showing the expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) for each of the Integrative cluster breast cancer subtypes.\n\n# plot the ESR1 expression for each integrative cluster\nintclust_plot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric) + \n  geom_boxplot(aes(x = \"Integrative_cluster\", y = \"ESR1\", fill = \"Integrative_cluster\")) + \n  labs(x = \"Integrative cluster\", y = \"ESR1 expression\")\n  )\nintclust_plot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default theme has the characteristic grey background which isn’t particularly suitable for printing on paper. We can change to one of a number of alternative themes available in the ggplot2 package, e.g. the black and white theme.\n\nfrom plotnine import theme_bw\nplot = (intclust_plot + theme_bw())\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of these themes is really just a collection of attributes relating to how various non-data elements of the plot will be displayed. We can override any of these individual settings using the theme() function. A look at the help page (help(plotnine.theme)) shows that there are a very large number of settings that you can change. The following example demonstrates a few of these.\n\nplot = (\n  intclust_plot + \n  theme_bw() + \n  theme(\n    panel_grid_major_x = element_blank(), \n    axis_ticks_major_x = element_blank(), \n    legend_position = \"none\")\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s another example that also involves customizing the labels, scales and colours.\n\nfrom plotnine import scale_fill_manual, element_line, element_text\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric) + \n  geom_bar(aes(x = \"3-gene_classifier\", fill = \"ER_status\")) + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = (0, 700), breaks = np.arange(0, 800, 100), expand = (0,0)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = [\"firebrick\", \"dodgerblue\"]) + \n  labs(x = '', y = \"samples\", fill = \"ER status\") + \n  theme_bw() + \n  theme(\n    panel_border = element_blank(), \n    panel_grid = element_blank(), \n    axis_ticks_major_x = element_blank(), \n    axis_text_x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1), \n    axis_line_y = element_line(), \n    axis_ticks_length = 8, \n    legend_position = \"bottom\")\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition adjustments\nAll geoms in ggplot have a position adjustment that can be set using the position argument. This has different effects for different types of plot but essentially this resolves how overlapping geoms are displayed.\nFor example, let’s consider the stacked bar plot we created earlier showing the numbers of patients in each of the 3-gene classifications subdivided by ER status. The default position value for geom_bar() is “stack” which is why the plot is shown as a stacked bar chart. An alternative way of representing these data would be to show separate bars for each ER status side-by-side by setting position = \"dodge\".\n\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric) + \n  geom_bar(aes(x = \"3-gene_classifier\", fill = \"ER_status\"), position = \"dodge\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = (0, 700), breaks = np.arange(0, 800, 100), expand = (0,0)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = [\"firebrick\", \"dodgerblue\"]) + \n  labs(x = '', y = \"samples\", fill = \"ER status\") + \n  theme_bw() + \n  theme(\n    panel_border = element_blank(), \n    panel_grid = element_blank(), \n    axis_ticks_major_x = element_blank(), \n    axis_text_x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1), \n    axis_line_y = element_line(), axis_ticks_length = 8)\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother position adjustment we’ve come across is geom_jitter(), which is just a convenient shortcut for geom_point(position = \"jitter\"). A variation on this, position_jitterdodge(), comes in handy when we are overlaying points on top of a box plot. We show an example of just such a plot in which first use postion = \"jitter\".\n\nfrom plotnine import scale_color_brewer, theme_minimal\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"3-gene_classifier\", y = \"ESR1\", colour = \"PR_status\")) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  geom_point(position = \"jitter\", size = 0.5, alpha = 0.3) + \n  labs(x = \"3-gene classification\", y = \"ESR1 expression\", colour = \"PR status\") + \n  scale_color_brewer(type = \"qualitative\", palette = \"Set1\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    panel_grid_major_x = element_blank(), \n    axis_text_x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1), \n    axis_ticks_major_x = element_blank())\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PR-negative and PR-positive points have distinct colours but are overlapping in a way that is aesthetically displeasing. What we want is for the points to have both jitter and to be dodged in the same way as the boxes. With position_jitterdodge() we get a better looking plot.\n\nfrom plotnine import position_jitterdodge\nplot = (\n  ggplot(data = metabric, mapping = aes(x = \"3-gene_classifier\", y = \"ESR1\", colour = \"PR_status\")) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  geom_point(position = position_jitterdodge(), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.3) + \n  labs(x = \"3-gene classification\", y = \"ESR1 expression\", colour = \"PR status\") + \n  scale_color_brewer(type = \"qualitative\", palette = \"Set1\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    panel_grid_major_x = element_blank(), \n    axis_text_x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1), \n    axis_ticks_major_x = element_blank())\n  )\nplot.draw()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis concludes the visualization section and the Introduction to Python materials. By now, you should be able to pre-process data, analyze it to uncover insights, and finally create aesthetically pleasing, publication-worthy plots. These skills will equip you with a solid foundation in data manipulation and visualization, enabling you to communicate your findings effectively through both analysis and visual storytelling."

It’s particularly useful for time series data or datasets where values are expected to follow a pattern.\nThe interpolate method employs various interpolation techniques to estimate missing values, including linear interpolation, polynomial interpolation, and more. The specific interpolation method used depends on the kind of data and the desired behavior.\n\nLinear Interpolation: Linear interpolation is the default method used by interpolate. It estimates missing values by drawing a straight line between two adjacent known data points and filling in the missing value with a value along that line. This method is suitable for data that appears to change linearly over time or between data points.\nPolynomial Interpolation: Polynomial interpolation uses higher-degree polynomial functions to estimate missing values. This method can capture more complex relationships between data points but may be susceptible to overfitting if not used carefully.\nTime-Based Interpolation: When working with time series data, you can use the method parameter to specify time-based interpolation methods such as ‘time’, ‘index’, or ‘values’. These methods consider the time or index values to estimate missing values.\n\nHere’s an example using linear interpolation:\n\ndf1.interpolate()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\n\n\n\n\na\n0.193068\n0.007566\n0.734591\n1.882367\n2013-01-01 00:00:00\n1.0\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\nb\n2.259496\n1.069983\n-1.401058\n-1.557589\n2013-01-02 00:00:00\n2.0\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\nc\n1.816851\n2.482994\n1.402377\n-0.937431\n2013-01-03 00:00:00\n3.0\n1.0\nNaN\n\n\nh\n0.981975\n0.820664\n0.634336\n0.003206\n2013-01-03 12:00:00\n3.5\n1.0\nNaN\n\n\nd\n0.147099\n-0.841666\n-1.717122\n0.943842\n2013-01-04 00:00:00\n4.0\n1.0\nNaN\n\n\ne\n-0.610573\n2.266561\n-0.231129\n1.313200\n2013-01-05 00:00:00\n5.0\n1.0\nNaN\n\n\nf\n-0.029106\n0.263028\n0.076878\n-0.525103\n2013-01-06 00:00:00\n6.0\n1.0\nNaN\n\n\ng\n-0.029106\n0.263028\n0.877525\n-0.525103\n2013-01-06 00:00:00\n6.0\n1.0\nNaN"

    "text": "Grouping data\nThe groupby function is a powerful feature within pandas that allows you to group and aggregate data in a DataFrame based on one or more columns. This can be especially useful when you want to perform summary statistics, calculations, or transformations on subsets of your data based on certain criteria. It involves one or more of the following steps:\n\nSplitting: The first step in a groupby operation is to split the DataFrame into groups based on the values in one or more columns. You specify the column(s) by which you want to group your data. This column is often referred to as the “key” or “grouping column”. Each unique value in the grouping column(s) forms a group, and the rows in the DataFrame are distributed among these groups.\nApplying a Function: After splitting the data into groups, you can apply various aggregation or transformation functions to each group. These functions are typically applied to one or more columns in each group. Common aggregation functions include sum, mean, count, min, max, and more. You can also apply custom functions or perform complex operations on the grouped data.\n\nAggregation: compute a summary statistic (or statistics) for each group. Examples: compute group sums or means, compute group size.\nTransformation: perform some group-specific computations and return a like-indexed object. Examples: standardize data (zscore) within a group, filling NAs within groups with a value derived from each group.\nFiltration: discard some groups, according to a group-wise computation that evaluates to True or False. Examples: discard data that belong to groups with only a few members, filter out data based on the group sum or mean.\n\nCombining Results: Once the specified function(s) are applied to each group, the results are combined into a new DataFrame or data structure. This final result will often have a hierarchical structure, with the grouping columns as index levels.\n\nConsider the following metabric dataset for the examples listed below.\n\n\n# Load the Metabric dataset from the URL into a DataFrame\nmetabric = pd.read_csv(\"https://zenodo.org/record/6450144/files/metabric_clinical_and_expression_data.csv\")\nmetabric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatient_ID\nCohort\nAge_at_diagnosis\nSurvival_time\nSurvival_status\nVital_status\nChemotherapy\nRadiotherapy\nTumour_size\nTumour_stage\n...\nIntegrative_cluster\nMutation_count\nESR1\nERBB2\nPGR\nTP53\nPIK3CA\nGATA3\nFOXA1\nMLPH\n\n\n\n\n0\nMB-0000\n1\n75.65\n140.500000\nLIVING\nLiving\nNO\nYES\n22.0\n2.0\n...\n4ER+\nNaN\n8.929817\n9.333972\n5.680501\n6.338739\n5.704157\n6.932146\n7.953794\n9.729728\n\n\n1\nMB-0002\n1\n43.19\n84.633333\nLIVING\nLiving\nNO\nYES\n10.0\n1.0\n...\n4ER+\n2.0\n10.047059\n9.729606\n7.505424\n6.192507\n5.757727\n11.251197\n11.843989\n12.536570\n\n\n2\nMB-0005\n1\n48.87\n163.700000\nDECEASED\nDied of Disease\nYES\nNO\n15.0\n2.0\n...\n3\n2.0\n10.041281\n9.725825\n7.376123\n6.404516\n6.751566\n9.289758\n11.698169\n10.306115\n\n\n3\nMB-0006\n1\n47.68\n164.933333\nLIVING\nLiving\nYES\nYES\n25.0\n2.0\n...\n9\n1.0\n10.404685\n10.334979\n6.815637\n6.869241\n7.219187\n8.667723\n11.863379\n10.472181\n\n\n4\nMB-0008\n1\n76.97\n41.366667\nDECEASED\nDied of Disease\nYES\nYES\n40.0\n2.0\n...\n9\n2.0\n11.276581\n9.956267\n7.331223\n6.337951\n5.817818\n9.719781\n11.625006\n12.161961\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n1899\nMB-7295\n4\n43.10\n196.866667\nLIVING\nLiving\nNO\nYES\n25.0\nNaN\n...\n3\n4.0\n9.591235\n9.935179\n7.984515\n6.753291\n6.279207\n9.207323\n11.281194\n11.337601\n\n\n1900\nMB-7296\n4\n42.88\n44.733333\nDECEASED\nDied of Disease\nNO\nYES\n20.0\nNaN\n...\n5\n6.0\n9.733986\n13.753037\n5.616082\n6.271912\n5.999093\n9.530390\n11.532033\n11.626140\n\n\n1901\nMB-7297\n4\n62.90\n175.966667\nDECEASED\nDied of Disease\nNO\nYES\n25.0\nNaN\n...\n1\n4.0\n11.053198\n10.228570\n7.478069\n6.212256\n6.192399\n9.540589\n11.482761\n11.180360\n\n\n1902\nMB-7298\n4\n61.16\n86.233333\nDECEASED\nDied of Other Causes\nNO\nNO\n25.0\nNaN\n...\n1\n15.0\n11.055114\n9.892589\n8.282737\n6.466712\n6.287254\n10.365901\n11.371176\n12.827069\n\n\n1903\nMB-7299\n4\n60.02\n201.900000\nDECEASED\nDied of Other Causes\nNO\nYES\n20.0\nNaN\n...\n10\n3.0\n10.696475\n10.227787\n5.533486\n6.180511\n6.208784\n9.749368\n10.867527\n9.847856\n\n\n\n\n1904 rows × 32 columns\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregation\nThis is primarily used for aggregating data (within groups when you use groupby).

It is also known as a lambda expression or lambda notation. Lambda functions are a way to create small, one-time-use functions without needing to define them using the def keyword. Lambda functions are typically used for short, simple operations where defining a full function using def would be overly verbose.\nlambda arguments: expression\nHere’s a simple example to illustrate the use of lambda functions:\n\n# Regular function to calculate the square of a number\ndef square(x):\n    return x ** 2\n\n# Equivalent lambda function to calculate the square of a number\nsquare_lambda = lambda x: x ** 2\n\n\n\n\nFiltration\nThis is the process of selecting rows from a DataFrame based on grouping.

    "text": "Tidy Data\nTidy data is a structured and organized format for presenting data that follows a simple convention: variables are placed in columns, observations are placed in rows and values are placed in cells. This standardized arrangement makes it easy to work with and analyze data efficiently. The principles of tidy data, are designed to promote consistency and ease of use in data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nData is often entered in a wide format, where each row typically represents a site, subject, or patient, and there are multiple observation variables containing the same type of data.\nFor instance, consider the AirPassengers dataset. It contains information on monthly airline passenger numbers from 1949 to 1960. In this dataset, each row corresponds to a single year, and the columns represent each month from January to December.\n\nWide format is intuitive for data entry. But it is less so for data analysis. Consider calculating the monthly mean; where would you place it? Would it be another row?\nData needs to be reshaped to conform to the tidy data structure.

While the original table consists of 40 rows, using pivot() results in only 20 rows. This reduction is due to the de-duplication of rows during the creation of new columns.\nIt’s important to note that since we only have two distinct labels in the Type column, we are essentially replacing the existing two columns with just two new columns. Consequently, the shape of the output doesn’t technically become wider than the input data frame. However, when there are more than two unique labels in the columns= column, the output will indeed become wider compared to the input.\n\n\nSeparate Columns\nFirst, read the metadata file called GSE60450_metadata.csv (the path to the file should be data/GSE60450_metadata.csv).\n\nmetadata = pd.read_csv(\"data/GSE60450_metadata.csv\")\nmetadata.head()\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngene_id\ncharacteristics\n\n\n\n\n0\nGSM1480291\nmammary gland;luminal cells;virgin\n\n\n1\nGSM1480292\nmammary gland;luminal cells;virgin\n\n\n2\nGSM1480293\nmammary gland;luminal cells;18.5 day pregnancy\n\n\n3\nGSM1480294\nmammary gland;luminal cells;18.5 day pregnancy\n\n\n4\nGSM1480295\nmammary gland;luminal cells;2 day lactation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo transform this table so that it conforms to the tidy principles, we use the str.split() function.

    "text": "Joining Data\nPandas provides two primary methods for combining DataFrames: concat and merge. These methods allow you to combine DataFrames along rows and columns, and they support various types of joins, including inner, left, right, and outer joins. Here’s an explanation of both methods and the types of joins they support:\n\nconcat\nThe concat method is used for concatenating (stacking) DataFrames along a particular axis, which can be either rows or columns. It’s particularly useful when you want to combine DataFrames with the same structure along a common axis. It does not require a common key to merge DataFrames, as it is primarily for stacking them.\nConsider the following three DataFrames,\n\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame({'A': ['A0', 'A1', 'A2'],\n                    'B': ['B0', 'B1', 'B2']})\n                    \ndf2 = pd.DataFrame({'A': ['A3', 'A4', 'A5'],\n                    'B': ['B3', 'B4', 'B5']})\n\ndf3 = pd.DataFrame({'C': ['C0', 'C1', 'C2'],\n                    'D': ['D0', 'D1', 'D2']})\n\n\nConcatenate along rows (vertically)\n\n\n\n\ndf1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\n0\nA0\nB0\n\n\n1\nA1\nB1\n\n\n2\nA2\nB2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\n0\nA3\nB3\n\n\n1\nA4\nB4\n\n\n2\nA5\nB5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npd.concat([df1, df2], axis=0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\n0\nA0\nB0\n\n\n1\nA1\nB1\n\n\n2\nA2\nB2\n\n\n0\nA3\nB3\n\n\n1\nA4\nB4\n\n\n2\nA5\nB5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcatenating along columns (horizontally)\n\n\n\n\ndf1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\n0\nA0\nB0\n\n\n1\nA1\nB1\n\n\n2\nA2\nB2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC\nD\n\n\n\n\n0\nC0\nD0\n\n\n1\nC1\nD1\n\n\n2\nC2\nD2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npd.concat([df1, df3], axis=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\n\n\n\n0\nA0\nB0\nC0\nD0\n\n\n1\nA1\nB1\nC1\nD1\n\n\n2\nA2\nB2\nC2\nD2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmerge\nThe merge method is used for merging DataFrames based on common columns or indexes, similar to SQL joins. It’s especially useful when you have different DataFrames with related data and want to combine them based on a shared key.\nConsider the following two DataFrames,\n\nleft = pd.DataFrame({\n         \"key1\": [\"K0\", \"K0\", \"K1\", \"K2\"],\n         \"key2\": [\"K0\", \"K1\", \"K0\", \"K1\"],\n         \"A\": [\"A0\", \"A1\", \"A2\", \"A3\"],\n         \"B\": [\"B0\", \"B1\", \"B2\", \"B3\"],\n     })\nright = pd.DataFrame({\n         \"key1\": [\"K0\", \"K1\", \"K1\", \"K2\"],\n         \"key2\": [\"K0\", \"K0\", \"K0\", \"K0\"],\n         \"C\": [\"C0\", \"C1\", \"C2\", \"C3\"],\n         \"D\": [\"D0\", \"D1\", \"D2\", \"D3\"],\n     })\n\n\nInner join\nAn inner join returns only the rows with matching values in the specified columns (the common key). It combines data from two or more tables or DataFrames based on the intersection of keys, excluding rows that do not have corresponding matches in both tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nleft\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkey1\nkey2\nA\nB\n\n\n\n\n0\nK0\nK0\nA0\nB0\n\n\n1\nK0\nK1\nA1\nB1\n\n\n2\nK1\nK0\nA2\nB2\n\n\n3\nK2\nK1\nA3\nB3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nright\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkey1\nkey2\nC\nD\n\n\n\n\n0\nK0\nK0\nC0\nD0\n\n\n1\nK1\nK0\nC1\nD1\n\n\n2\nK1\nK0\nC2\nD2\n\n\n3\nK2\nK0\nC3\nD3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npd.merge(left, right, how=\"inner\", on=[\"key1\", \"key2\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkey1\nkey2\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\n\n\n\n0\nK0\nK0\nA0\nB0\nC0\nD0\n\n\n1\nK1\nK0\nA2\nB2\nC1\nD1\n\n\n2\nK1\nK0\nA2\nB2\nC2\nD2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOuter join\nAn outer join returns all rows from both tables, including rows with matching keys and rows with non-matching keys.

    "section": "String Manipulation in Pandas",
    "text": "String Manipulation in Pandas\nString manipulation is an essential part of data pre-processing and analysis in Pandas, especially when dealing with textual data. The str accessor in Pandas provides a wide range of string functions that allow you to clean, transform, and extract valuable information from text data within a DataFrame.\nHere, we explore some of the most commonly used string manipulation functions available in Pandas for DataFrames.\n\nstr.replace() Replaces occurrences of a pattern (string or regex) with another string.\n\ncms.columns.str.replace(' ','_')  # Replace \"_\" with spaces\n\nIndex(['ID', 'Facility_Name', 'County', 'Hospital_Type', 'Star_Rating',\n       'No_of_Surveys', 'Response_Rate', 'Overall_Rating'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\nstr.contains()\nChecks if each string contains a specified substring (can use regular expressions).\n\nmask = cms[\"Facility Name\"].str.contains('GENERAL')\ncms[mask]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nFacility Name\nCounty\nHospital Type\nStar Rating\nNo of Surveys\nResponse Rate\nOverall Rating\n\n\n\n\n6\n151317\nGREENE COUNTY GENERAL HOSPITAL\nGREENE\nCritical Access Hospital\n3\n114\n22\n3\n\n\n8\n490057\nSENTARA GENERAL HOSPITAL\nVIRGINIA BEACH\nAcute Care Hospital\n4\n619\n32\n3\n\n\n13\n501339\nWHIDBEY GENERAL HOSPITAL\nISLAND\nCritical Access Hospital\n3\n389\n29\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncol_mask = cms.columns.str.contains('Rating')\ncms.columns[col_mask]\n\nIndex(['Star Rating', 'Overall Rating'], dtype='object')\n\n\nChecks if each string contains a specified regular expression pattern.\n\nmask_col = cms.columns.str.contains('[A-Z][a-z]*\\s[A-Z][a-z]{3}$')\ncms.columns[mask_col]\n\nIndex(['Facility Name', 'Hospital Type', 'Response Rate'], dtype='object')\n\n\nHere, the regular expression [A-Z][a-z]*\\s[A-Z][a-z]{3}$ can be broken down into smaller chunks for better understanding:\n\n[A-Z] matches an uppercase character from ‘A’ to ‘Z’.\n[a-z]* matches a set of lowercase characters from ‘a’ to ‘z’.\nmatches a space.\n[A-Z] matches an uppercase character from ‘A’ to ‘Z’.\n[a-z]{3} matches any three lowercase characters from ‘a’ to ‘z’.\n$ matches the end of the string\n\nPutting this together, the expression selects column names that contains two words of characters separated by a space with the first character in each word in upper case and the second word have four characters. Thus, it should match column names: Facility Name, Hospital Type, and Response Rate.\nIf you’re unfamiliar with regular expressions, you can skip this section for now. However, interested readers can find many online resources to learn about regular expressions. One of my favorite online tools for building and testing regular expressions is https://regexr.com. You can use this tool to test the correctness of a regular expression.\nstr.startswith() and str.endswith() Checks if each string starts or ends with a specified substring.\n\nmask_county = cms.County.str.startswith('S')\ncms.County[mask_county]\n\n0     SAN DIEGO\n3     SEBASTIAN\n4        SHELBY\n12       SUMNER\nName: County, dtype: object\n\n\n\nmask_col = cms.columns.str.endswith('e')\ncms.columns[mask_col]\n\nIndex(['Facility Name', 'Hospital Type', 'Response Rate'], dtype='object')\n\n\nstr.len() Returns the length of each string in the Series.\n\ncms['County'].str.len()\n\n0      9\n1      4\n2      4\n3      9\n4      6\n5      6\n6      6\n7      9\n8     14\n9      7\n10    11\n11    10\n12     6\n13     6\n14    11\nName: County, dtype: int64\n\n\nstr.split() Splits each string in the Series into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter.\n\ncms['Hospital Type'].str.split().str[0]  # Split the Hospital Type column and take the first part\n\n0        Acute\n1        Acute\n2        Acute\n3        Acute\n4        Acute\n5        Acute\n6     Critical\n7     Critical\n8        Acute\n9        Acute\n10       Acute\n11       Acute\n12       Acute\n13    Critical\n14       Acute\nName: Hospital Type, dtype: object\n\n\nstr.join() Concatenates a list of strings into a single string with a specified separator.\n\ncms[['Facility Name', 'County']].apply(','.join, axis=1)  # Join first and last names\n\n0            SCRIPPS GREEN HOSPITAL,SAN DIEGO\n1                    ST BERNARD HOSPITAL,COOK\n2                    SOUTH LAKE HOSPITAL,LAKE\n3         MERCY HOSPITAL FORT SMITH,SEBASTIAN\n4            BAPTIST MEMORIAL HOSPITAL,SHELBY\n5     ST JOSEPH REGIONAL HEALTH CENTER,BRAZOS\n6       GREENE COUNTY GENERAL HOSPITAL,GREENE\n7       SOUTHWEST MEMORIAL HOSPITAL,MONTEZUMA\n8     SENTARA GENERAL HOSPITAL,VIRGINIA BEACH\n9           PIEDMONT FAYETTE HOSPITAL,FAYETTE\n10     MISSION COMMUNITY HOSPITAL,LOS ANGELES\n11                DOCTORS HOSPITAL,MIAMI-DADE\n12      SUMNER REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER,SUMNER\n13            WHIDBEY GENERAL HOSPITAL,ISLAND\n14      NORTHRIDGE MEDICAL CENTER,LOS ANGELES\ndtype: object\n\n\nstr.find() Returns the lowest index of the substring;

By the end of this section, you should now be able to confidently read and write datasets into and from DataFrames, pre-process and clean data, handle missing values, group, join, and transform data, and perform basic statistical analysis to gain insights into the underlying data.\nIn the next section, we will dive into data visualization, where you’ll learn how to create insightful and compelling charts and plots using the plotnine package to better communicate your findings."

    "title": "Basics of Python Programming Language",
    "section": "Sequences",
    "text": "Sequences\nThe most basic data structure in Python is the sequence. Sequences are compound data types, and used to group together other values. Each element of a sequence is assigned a number - its position or index. The first index is zero, the second index is one, and so forth.\nThere are certain things you can do with all sequence types. These operations include indexing, slicing, adding, multiplying, and checking for membership. In addition, Python has many built-in functions to be used with sequence types: e.g., for finding the length of a sequence and for finding its largest and smallest elements.\nPython has seven built-in types of sequences (strings, bytes, lists, tuples, bytearrays, buffers, and range objects); the most common one is lists, which we will discuss now.\n\nLists\nThe list is the most versatile data-type available in Python which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Items in a list need not all have the same type. Creating a list is as simple as listing different comma-separated values between square brackets.\n\nlist1 = ['ATG', 'TCA', 23, 12]\nlist2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]\nlist3 = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", 'pqr', 12.345]\n\n\nAccesing values in Lists\nTo access values in lists, use square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain value available at that index.\n\nlist1 = ['ATG', 'TCA', 23, 12]    # create a list \nprint(\"list1[0] -\", list1[0])     # print the first element in the list\n\nlist2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]          # create a list \nprint(\"list2[1:5] -\", list2[1:5]) # print elements from 2 to 6\n\nA few other examples of indexing and slicing:\n\nlist1 = ['Adenine', 'Cytosine', 'Guanine', 'Thymine']\nprint(list1[2])\nprint(list1[-3])\nprint(list1[2:])\nprint(list1[:-2])\n\n\n\nUpdating Lists\nYou can update single or multiple elements of lists by giving the slice on the left-hand side of the assignment operator. This will access single or multiple elements as mentioned above. Then, provide the new values that you need to change on the right-hand side of the assignment operator. Make sure the number of accessed elements are the same as the number of assigning (new) elements.\n\nlist1 = ['ATG', 'TCA', 23, 12]              # create a list\nprint(\"Value at index 3 : \", list1[3])      # print the 4th element\n\nlist1[3] = 'GGC'                            # update the 4th element\nprint(\"New value at index 3 : \", list1[3])  # print the 4th element\n\nAdditionally, you can add elements to the end of a list (even an empty list) with the append() function.\n\nlist1.append('CCG')                         # insert element at the end of the list\nprint(list1)                                # print the list\n\n\n\nDeleting List elements\nTo remove a list element, you can use either the del statement if you know exactly which element(s) you are deleting.\n\nprint(\"List of 5 elements =\", list1)          # print list1 \ndel list1[2]                                  # delete element based on its index (3rd element)\nprint(\"After deleting 2nd element =\", list1)  # print list1 \n\nThe remove() method of a list object can also be used to delete the element based on the value.\n\nlist1.remove('TCA')                           # delete element based on its value ('TCA')\nprint(\"After removing TCA element =\",list1)   # print list1 \n\nAlternatively, you can use del statement after using the index() function to find the index of the element based on its value:\n\nindx = list1.index('GGC')                     # get index of element 'GGC'\ndel list1[indx]                               # delete element based on its index \nprint(\"After deleting GGC element =\", list1)  # print list1 \n\n\n\nOther List operations\nLists respond to the + and * operators (much like strings, discussed next), where ‘+’ means concatenation and ‘*’ means repetition, and the result is a new list. In fact, lists respond to all general sequence operations.\n\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nprint(\"Length of the list =\", len(list1))     # length\n\n\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6]\nprint(\"Concatenated list =\", list1 + list2)   # concatenation\n\n\nprint(\"Repeating list elements =\", list1 * 3) # repetition \n\n\nprint(\"Is 3 a member of list1?\", 3 in list1)  # membership\n\n\nfor x in list1:                               # iteration (discussed in detail later)\n  print(x, end=' ')\n\n\n\n\nStrings\nStrings are amongst the most popular types in Python. We can create them simply by enclosing characters in quotes. Python treats single quotes (’‘) the same as double quotes (““). That is, ‘aaa’ and”aaa” are the same. A string can also be triple quoted, either with three single quotes, as’‘’aaa’’’, or three double quotes, as “““aaa”““.\n\nstr1 = 'This is a string'\nstr2 = \"This is also a string\"\nstr3 = \"\"\"This is a string that extends \nover multiple lines\"\"\"\nprint(str1, str2, str3, sep='\\n')\n\nStrings can be concatenated (glued together) with the + operator, and repeated with * (similar to lists). This is another way to create new strings.\n\nwords = 'This' + 'is' + 'concatenation' # concatenation\nprint(\"Concatenation =\", words)\nprint(\"Repetition =\", 'ACG' * 3)        # repetition\nprint(\"Length =\", len(words))           # length\nprint(\"Membership =\", \"is\" in words)    # membership\n\n\nfor x in words:      # iteration (discussed in detail later)\n  print(x, end='|')\n\nPython does not support a character type; these are treated as strings of length one, thus also considered a substring. Individual elements can be accessed with an index. Substrings can be specified with the slice notation: two indices separated by a colon.\nStrings can be accessed and manipulated using similar operations we introduced above for lists.\n\nprint(words)\nprint(words[4])\nprint(words[0:6])\nprint(words[6:])\nprint(words[-15:])\n\n\ntext = \"ATGTCATTTGT\"\ntext[0:2] = \"CCC\"\n\nTo change a value in a string, replace() function can be used.\n\nlong_text = \"\"\"Betty bought some butter. \nBut the butter was bitter. \nSo, betty baught more butter to make bitter butter better\"\"\"\nprint(\"Replaced text = \", long_text.replace(\"butter\", \"egg\"))\n\nThe in operator lets you check if a substring is contained within a larger string, but it does not tell you where the substring is located. This is often useful to know and python provides the .find() method which returns the index of the first occurrence of the search string, and the .rfind() method to start searching from the end of the string. If the search string is not found in the string both these methods return -1.\n\ndna = \"ATGTCACCGTTTGGC\"\nprint(\"TCA is at position:\", dna.find(\"TCA\"))\nprint(\"The last Cytosine is at position:\", dna.rfind('C'))\nprint(\"Number of Adenines:\", dna.count(\"A\"))\n\nWhen we read text from files (which we will see in the next workshop), often there is unwanted whitespace at the start or end of the string. We can remove leading whitespace with the .lstrip() method, trailing whitespace with .rstrip(), and whitespace from both ends with .strip().\nAll of these methods return a copy of the changed string, so if you want to replace the original you can assign the result of the method call to the original variable.\n\nstring = \"           This is a string with leading and trailing spaces             \"\nprint('|', string, '|')\nprint('|', string.lstrip(), '|')\nprint('|', string.rstrip(), '|')\nprint('|', string.strip(), '|')\n\nYou can split a string into a list of substrings using the .split() method, supplying the delimiter as an argument to the method. If you don’t supply any delimiter the method will split the string on whitespace by default (which is very often what you want!)\n\nseq = \"ATG TCA CCG GGC\"\ncodons = seq.split(\" \")\nprint(codons)\n\nTo split a string into its component characters you can simply cast the string to a list:\n\nbases = list(seq)\nprint(bases)\n\n.split() is the counterpart to the .join() method that lets you join the elements of a list into a string only if all the elements are of type String.\n\nprint(codons)\nprint(\"|\".join(codons))\n\nWe also saw earlier that the + operator lets you concatenate strings together into a larger string. Note that this operator only works on variables of the same type. If you want to concatenate a string with an integer (or some other type), first you have to cast the integer to a string with the str() function.\n\ns = \"chr\"\nchrom_number = 2\nprint(s + str(chrom_number))\n\n\n\nDictionary\nSometimes we want to access data by some useful name rather than an index. For example, as a result of some experiment we may have a set of genes and corresponding expression values. We could put the expression values in a list, but then we’d have to remember which index in the list correspond to which gene and this would quickly get complicated. For these situations a dictionary is a very useful data structure.\nDictionaries contain a mapping of keys to values (like a word and its corresponding definition in a dictionary). The keys of a dictionary are unique (i.e. they cannot repeat). Dictionaries do not store data in any particular order.\n\ndna = {\"A\": \"Adenine\", \"C\": \"Cytosine\", \"G\": \"Guanine\", \"T\": \"Thymine\"}\nprint(dna)\n\nYou can access values in a dictionary using the key inside square brackets.\n\nprint(\"A represents\", dna[\"A\"])\nprint(\"G represents\", dna[\"G\"])\n\nAn error is triggered if a key is absent from the dictionary.\n\nprint(\"N represents\", dna[\"N\"])\n\nYou can access values safely with the get method, which gives back None if the key is absent and you can also supply a default values.\n\nprint(\"N represents\", dna.get(\"N\"))\nprint(\"N represents (with a default value)\", dna.get(\"N\", \"unknown\"))\n\nExamples of some operators used with dictionaries.\n\ndna = {\"A\": \"Adenine\", \"C\": \"Cytosine\", \"G\": \"Guanine\", \"T\": \"Thymine\"}\n\n# check if a key is in/not in a dictionary\nprint(\"G\" in dna)\nprint(\"Y\" not in dna)\n\n\n# length of a dictionary\nprint(len(dna))\n\n\nprint(dna)\n# assign new values to a dictionary\ndna['Y'] = 'Pyrimidine'\nprint(dna)\n\n\n# change value of an existing key\ndna['Y'] = 'Cytosine or Thymine'\nprint(dna)\n\n\n# list all the keys\nprint(list(dna.keys()))\n# list all values\nprint(list(dna.values()))\n# list all key value pairs\nprint(list(dna.items()))"

    "section": "Control Structures in Python",
    "text": "Control Structures in Python\nIn a program, control flow (or flow of control) refers to the order in which individual statements of the program are executed. Similarly, control flow in an algorithm is the order in which individual steps of the algorithm are executed.\nSo far, we have considered sequential control flow, i.e., statements getting executed from top to bottom, in the order they appear in the program. The sequential flow of control is the default behavior. However, we often need to alter this flow when we write programs, because the problems we can solve with sequential control flow alone are limited to simple (or, as one might say, trivial) problems. In other words, there are many problems that cannot be solved with the sequential control flow alone.\nMany problems that we encounter are complex enough that they require programs with enhanced control flows. For this, most programming languages provide at least three control structures for altering the default sequential flow. These control structures are known as selection, loop, and subprogram. Together with the default sequential flow, we have four control structures for specifying the control flow as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelection Control Structure\n\nif structure\nThe if structure in Python is similar to that of other languages. It contains an expression followed by a set of statements to be executed if the expression is evaluated as true.\nif expression:\n  statement_1\n  statement_2\n  ...\n  statement_n\nNote that, in Python, all statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a programming construct are considered to be part of a single block of code. Python uses indentation as its method of grouping statements.\n\n\nif ... else structure\nTo implement the selection control structure shown in subfigure (b) above with both blocks A and B specified, the else keyword can be combined with the if keyword. The else keyword is followed by the code that gets executed if the if-body does not get executed (i.e., conditional expression is not evaluated to true).\nThe else part is optional and there could be at most one else part following an if part. Further, an else part cannot exist alone; it must be paired with an if part.\nif expression:\n  statement(s)\nelse:\n  statement(s)\n\n\nMulti-way Selection with the elif Keyword\nThe elif keyword (meaning “else-if”) allows us to implement multi-way selection, going beyond the two-way selection in the if-else structure. This means, we can select one block of code for execution from among many (&gt; 2). For this, we need to specify multiple conditional expressions for truth value and execute a block of code as soon as the corresponding expression evaluates to true.\nAn elif part is optional and there can be an arbitrary number of elif parts following an if part.\nif expression_1:\n  statement(s)\nelif expression_2:\n  statement(s)  \nelif expression_3:\n  statement(s)  \n...\nelse:\n  statement(s)\nThe if...elif structure is a substitute for the “switch-case” structure in some other languages such as C.\n\n\n\nLoop Control Structure\nPython provides two loop structures: the for loop and the while loop. We can also have nested loops.\n\nThe for loop\nThe for loop construct is used to repeat a statement or block of statements specified number of times. The for loop can also iterate over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.\nfor iterating_var in sequence:\n   statements(s)\nThe block of statements executed repeatedly is called the loop body. The loop body is indented.\nIf the sequence contains an expression list, it is evaluated first. Then, the first item in the sequence is assigned to the iterating variable iterating_var and the loop body is executed. This concludes one iteration of the loop. Next the second iteration of the loop body is executed after the second item is assigned to the iterating variable iterating_var. Similarly, the loop body is executed repeatedly, with a unique item in the list assigned to iterating_var in each iteration, until the entire sequence is exhausted.\nThe range() function: If we do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function range() comes in handy. It generates lists containing arithmetic progressions. Implementation of range() is as either range(stop) or range(start, stop[, step]). Here are four examples.\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i, end=' ')\n\n\nfor i in range(5, 10):\n    print(i, end=' ')\n\n\nfor i in range(0, 10, 3):\n    print(i, end=' ')\n\n\nfor i in range(-10, -100, -30):\n    print(i, end=' ')\n\nTo iterate over the indices of a list or sequence using a for loop, you can combine range() and len() functions as follows:\n\nlist_a = ['John', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'puppy']\n# using range and len functions\nfor i in range(len(list_a)):\n  print(i, list_a[i])\n\nOr using enumerate() function:\n\n# using enumerate function\nfor elem in enumerate(list_a):\n  print(elem)\n\n\n\nThe while loop\nA while loop in Python repeatedly executes the loop body as long as a given condition is true. The condition is specified by an expression.\nwhile expression:\n  statement(s)\nThe block of statements executed repeatedly is the loop body, which is indented, as in the for loop.\nThe condition to execute the loop body is considered true if the expression is true or it is any non-zero value. The loop iterates while the condition is true. When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately following the loop body.\nNote that the while loop might not ever run. When the condition is tested and the result is false, the loop body will be skipped and the first statement after the while loop will be executed.\n\n\nThe break keyword\nThe break keyword is used inside a loop and is used for terminating the current iteration of the loop body immediately; i.e., to break out of the smallest enclosing for or while loop. The control will be transferred to the first statement following the loop body. If you are inside the inner loop of a nested loop, then the break statement inside that inner loop transfers the control to the immediate outer loop. The break statement can be used to terminate an infinite loop or to force a loop to end before its normal termination.\n\nn = 10;\nfor var in range(0, n):\n    print(var)\n    if (var == 5):\n        print(\"Countdown Aborted\")\n        break;\n\n\n\nThe continue keyword\nThe continue keyword inside a loop causes the program to skip the rest of the loop body in the current iteration, causing it to continue with the next iteration of the loop.\n\nfor i in range(-2,3):\n  if i == 0 :\n      continue\n  print(\"5 divided by \", i, \" is: \", (5.0/i))"

    "text": "Functions\nA function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single task. Functions are the subprogram control structure in Python. Functions provide better modularity for our programs and a high degree of code reuse.\nAs you already know, Python gives you many built-in functions like print(), etc. But you can also create your own functions which are called user-defined functions.\ndef function_name( parameters ): \n  function_suite\nreturn [expression]\nBy default, parameters have a positional behavior; thus when invoking (calling) the function you need to list them in the same order that they were defined. Defining a function only gives it a name, specifies the parameters that are to be included in the function and structures the blocks of code. Once the function is defined, you can execute it by calling it from your (main) program, another function or directly from the Python prompt.\nIn the following example, we define and call the readDataset() function.\n\n# Function definition to read the cms_hospital_patient_satisfaction_2016_sampled.csv file\n# This function does not require any parameters \ndef readDataset():\n  with open('data/patient_satisfaction/cms_hospital_patient_satisfaction_2016_sampled.csv') as f:\n    cms = f.read().splitlines()\n  return cms\n\n# Now you can call readDataset function\ncms = readDataset()\nprint(cms)\n\nIn the following example, we define two functions printHead() and printTail() to print the top 5 and bottom 5 rows of a list. Note that in this example, the return is optional (the program will work even without the return).\n\n# function definition to print the top 5 elements in a list\ndef printHead(inp_list):\n  for i in range(5):\n    print(inp_list[i])\n\n# function definition to print the bottom 5 elements in a list\ndef printTail(inp_list):\n  for i in range(len(inp_list)-5, len(inp_list)):\n    print(inp_list[i])\n\n\n# function call to printHead with melanoma dataset as an input parameter to the function\nprintHead(cms)\n\n\n# function call to printTail with melanoma dataset as an input parameter to the function\nprintTail(cms)"

    "title": "Basics of Python Programming Language",
    "section": "Sequences",
    "text": "Sequences\nThe most basic data structure in Python is the sequence. Sequences are compound data types, and used to group together other values. Each element of a sequence is assigned a number - its position or index. The first index is zero, the second index is one, and so forth.\nThere are certain things you can do with all sequence types. These operations include indexing, slicing, adding, multiplying, and checking for membership. In addition, Python has many built-in functions to be used with sequence types: e.g., for finding the length of a sequence and for finding its largest and smallest elements.\nPython has seven built-in types of sequences (strings, bytes, lists, tuples, bytearrays, buffers, and range objects); the most common one is lists, which we will discuss now.\n\nLists\nThe list is the most versatile data-type available in Python which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Items in a list need not all have the same type. Creating a list is as simple as listing different comma-separated values between square brackets.\n\nlist1 = ['ATG', 'TCA', 23, 12]\nlist2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]\nlist3 = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", 'pqr', 12.345]\n\n\nAccesing values in Lists\nTo access values in lists, use square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain value available at that index.\n\nlist1 = ['ATG', 'TCA', 23, 12]    # create a list \nprint(\"list1[0] -\", list1[0])     # print the first element in the list\n\nlist2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]          # create a list \nprint(\"list2[1:5] -\", list2[1:5]) # print elements from 2 to 6\n\nlist1[0] - ATG\nlist2[1:5] - [2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n\nA few other examples of indexing and slicing:\n\nlist1 = ['Adenine', 'Cytosine', 'Guanine', 'Thymine']\nprint(list1[2])\nprint(list1[-3])\nprint(list1[2:])\nprint(list1[:-2])\n\nGuanine\nCytosine\n['Guanine', 'Thymine']\n['Adenine', 'Cytosine']\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Lists\nYou can update single or multiple elements of lists by giving the slice on the left-hand side of the assignment operator. This will access single or multiple elements as mentioned above. Then, provide the new values that you need to change on the right-hand side of the assignment operator. Make sure the number of accessed elements are the same as the number of assigning (new) elements.\n\nlist1 = ['ATG', 'TCA', 23, 12]              # create a list\nprint(\"Value at index 3 : \", list1[3])      # print the 4th element\n\nlist1[3] = 'GGC'                            # update the 4th element\nprint(\"New value at index 3 : \", list1[3])  # print the 4th element\n\nValue at index 3 :  12\nNew value at index 3 :  GGC\n\n\nAdditionally, you can add elements to the end of a list (even an empty list) with the append() function.\n\nlist1.append('CCG')                         # insert element at the end of the list\nprint(list1)                                # print the list\n\n['ATG', 'TCA', 23, 'GGC', 'CCG']\n\n\n\n\nDeleting List elements\nTo remove a list element, you can use either the del statement if you know exactly which element(s) you are deleting.\n\nprint(\"List of 5 elements =\", list1)          # print list1 \ndel list1[2]                                  # delete element based on its index (3rd element)\nprint(\"After deleting 2nd element =\", list1)  # print list1 \n\nList of 5 elements = ['ATG', 'TCA', 23, 'GGC', 'CCG']\nAfter deleting 2nd element = ['ATG', 'TCA', 'GGC', 'CCG']\n\n\nThe remove() method of a list object can also be used to delete the element based on the value.\n\nlist1.remove('TCA')                           # delete element based on its value ('TCA')\nprint(\"After removing TCA element =\",list1)   # print list1 \n\nAfter removing TCA element = ['ATG', 'GGC', 'CCG']\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use del statement after using the index() function to find the index of the element based on its value:\n\nindx = list1.index('GGC')                     # get index of element 'GGC'\ndel list1[indx]                               # delete element based on its index \nprint(\"After deleting GGC element =\", list1)  # print list1 \n\nAfter deleting GGC element = ['ATG', 'CCG']\n\n\n\n\nOther List operations\nLists respond to the + and * operators (much like strings, discussed next), where ‘+’ means concatenation and ‘*’ means repetition, and the result is a new list. In fact, lists respond to all general sequence operations.\n\nlist1 = [1, 2, 3]\nprint(\"Length of the list =\", len(list1))     # length\n\nLength of the list = 3\n\n\n\nlist2 = [4, 5, 6]\nprint(\"Concatenated list =\", list1 + list2)   # concatenation\n\nConcatenated list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\n\n\nprint(\"Repeating list elements =\", list1 * 3) # repetition \n\nRepeating list elements = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n\n\n\nprint(\"Is 3 a member of list1?\", 3 in list1)  # membership\n\nIs 3 a member of list1? True\n\n\n\nfor x in list1:                               # iteration (discussed in detail later)\n  print(x, end=' ')\n\n1 2 3 \n\n\n\n\n\nStrings\nStrings are amongst the most popular types in Python. We can create them simply by enclosing characters in quotes. Python treats single quotes (’‘) the same as double quotes (““). That is, ‘aaa’ and”aaa” are the same. A string can also be triple quoted, either with three single quotes, as’‘’aaa’’’, or three double quotes, as “““aaa”““.\n\nstr1 = 'This is a string'\nstr2 = \"This is also a string\"\nstr3 = \"\"\"This is a string that extends \nover multiple lines\"\"\"\nprint(str1, str2, str3, sep='\\n')\n\nThis is a string\nThis is also a string\nThis is a string that extends \nover multiple lines\n\n\nStrings can be concatenated (glued together) with the + operator, and repeated with * (similar to lists). This is another way to create new strings.\n\nwords = 'This' + 'is' + 'concatenation' # concatenation\nprint(\"Concatenation =\", words)\nprint(\"Repetition =\", 'ACG' * 3)        # repetition\nprint(\"Length =\", len(words))           # length\nprint(\"Membership =\", \"is\" in words)    # membership\n\nConcatenation = Thisisconcatenation\nRepetition = ACGACGACG\nLength = 19\nMembership = True\n\n\n\nfor x in words:      # iteration (discussed in detail later)\n  print(x, end='|')\n\nT|h|i|s|i|s|c|o|n|c|a|t|e|n|a|t|i|o|n|\n\n\nPython does not support a character type; these are treated as strings of length one, thus also considered a substring. Individual elements can be accessed with an index. Substrings can be specified with the slice notation: two indices separated by a colon.\nStrings can be accessed and manipulated using similar operations we introduced above for lists.\n\nprint(words)\nprint(words[4])\nprint(words[0:6])\nprint(words[6:])\nprint(words[-15:])\n\nThisisconcatenation\ni\nThisis\nconcatenation\nisconcatenation\n\n\n\ntext = \"ATGTCATTTGT\"\ntext[0:2] = \"CCC\"\n\nTypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\n\n\nTo change a value in a string, replace() function can be used.\n\nlong_text = \"\"\"Betty bought some butter. \nBut the butter was bitter. \nSo, betty baught more butter to make bitter butter better\"\"\"\nprint(\"Replaced text = \", long_text.replace(\"butter\", \"egg\"))\n\nReplaced text =  Betty bought some egg. \nBut the egg was bitter. \nSo, betty baught more egg to make bitter egg better\n\n\nThe in operator lets you check if a substring is contained within a larger string, but it does not tell you where the substring is located. This is often useful to know and python provides the .find() method which returns the index of the first occurrence of the search string, and the .rfind() method to start searching from the end of the string. If the search string is not found in the string both these methods return -1.\n\ndna = \"ATGTCACCGTTTGGC\"\nprint(\"TCA is at position:\", dna.find(\"TCA\"))\nprint(\"The last Cytosine is at position:\", dna.rfind('C'))\nprint(\"Number of Adenines:\", dna.count(\"A\"))\n\nTCA is at position: 3\nThe last Cytosine is at position: 14\nNumber of Adenines: 2\n\n\nWhen we read text from files (which we will see in the next workshop), often there is unwanted whitespace at the start or end of the string. We can remove leading whitespace with the .lstrip() method, trailing whitespace with .rstrip(), and whitespace from both ends with .strip().\nAll of these methods return a copy of the changed string, so if you want to replace the original you can assign the result of the method call to the original variable.\n\nstring = \"           This is a string with leading and trailing spaces             \"\nprint('|', string, '|')\nprint('|', string.lstrip(), '|')\nprint('|', string.rstrip(), '|')\nprint('|', string.strip(), '|')\n\n|            This is a string with leading and trailing spaces              |\n| This is a string with leading and trailing spaces              |\n|            This is a string with leading and trailing spaces |\n| This is a string with leading and trailing spaces |\n\n\nYou can split a string into a list of substrings using the .split() method, supplying the delimiter as an argument to the method. If you don’t supply any delimiter the method will split the string on whitespace by default (which is very often what you want!)\n\nseq = \"ATG TCA CCG GGC\"\ncodons = seq.split(\" \")\nprint(codons)\n\n['ATG', 'TCA', 'CCG', 'GGC']\n\n\nTo split a string into its component characters you can simply cast the string to a list:\n\nbases = list(seq)\nprint(bases)\n\n['A', 'T', 'G', ' ', 'T', 'C', 'A', ' ', 'C', 'C', 'G', ' ', 'G', 'G', 'C']\n\n\n.split() is the counterpart to the .join() method that lets you join the elements of a list into a string only if all the elements are of type String.\n\nprint(codons)\nprint(\"|\".join(codons))\n\n['ATG', 'TCA', 'CCG', 'GGC']\nATG|TCA|CCG|GGC\n\n\nWe also saw earlier that the + operator lets you concatenate strings together into a larger string. Note that this operator only works on variables of the same type. If you want to concatenate a string with an integer (or some other type), first you have to cast the integer to a string with the str() function.\n\ns = \"chr\"\nchrom_number = 2\nprint(s + str(chrom_number))\n\nchr2\n\n\n\n\nDictionary\nSometimes we want to access data by some useful name rather than an index. For example, as a result of some experiment we may have a set of genes and corresponding expression values. We could put the expression values in a list, but then we’d have to remember which index in the list correspond to which gene and this would quickly get complicated. For these situations a dictionary is a very useful data structure.\nDictionaries contain a mapping of keys to values (like a word and its corresponding definition in a dictionary). The keys of a dictionary are unique (i.e. they cannot repeat). Dictionaries do not store data in any particular order.\n\ndna = {\"A\": \"Adenine\", \"C\": \"Cytosine\", \"G\": \"Guanine\", \"T\": \"Thymine\"}\nprint(dna)\n\n{'A': 'Adenine', 'C': 'Cytosine', 'G': 'Guanine', 'T': 'Thymine'}\n\n\nYou can access values in a dictionary using the key inside square brackets.\n\nprint(\"A represents\", dna[\"A\"])\nprint(\"G represents\", dna[\"G\"])\n\nA represents Adenine\nG represents Guanine\n\n\nAn error is triggered if a key is absent from the dictionary.\n\nprint(\"N represents\", dna[\"N\"])\n\nKeyError: 'N'\n\n\nYou can access values safely with the get method, which gives back None if the key is absent and you can also supply a default values.\n\nprint(\"N represents\", dna.get(\"N\"))\nprint(\"N represents (with a default value)\", dna.get(\"N\", \"unknown\"))\n\nN represents None\nN represents (with a default value) unknown\n\n\nExamples of some operators used with dictionaries.\n\ndna = {\"A\": \"Adenine\", \"C\": \"Cytosine\", \"G\": \"Guanine\", \"T\": \"Thymine\"}\n\n# check if a key is in/not in a dictionary\nprint(\"G\" in dna)\nprint(\"Y\" not in dna)\n\nTrue\nTrue\n\n\n\n# length of a dictionary\nprint(len(dna))\n\n4\n\n\n\nprint(dna)\n# assign new values to a dictionary\ndna['Y'] = 'Pyrimidine'\nprint(dna)\n\n{'A': 'Adenine', 'C': 'Cytosine', 'G': 'Guanine', 'T': 'Thymine'}\n{'A': 'Adenine', 'C': 'Cytosine', 'G': 'Guanine', 'T': 'Thymine', 'Y': 'Pyrimidine'}\n\n\n\n# change value of an existing key\ndna['Y'] = 'Cytosine or Thymine'\nprint(dna)\n\n{'A': 'Adenine', 'C': 'Cytosine', 'G': 'Guanine', 'T': 'Thymine', 'Y': 'Cytosine or Thymine'}\n\n\n\n# list all the keys\nprint(list(dna.keys()))\n# list all values\nprint(list(dna.values()))\n# list all key value pairs\nprint(list(dna.items()))\n\n['A', 'C', 'G', 'T', 'Y']\n['Adenine', 'Cytosine', 'Guanine', 'Thymine', 'Cytosine or Thymine']\n[('A', 'Adenine'), ('C', 'Cytosine'), ('G', 'Guanine'), ('T', 'Thymine'), ('Y', 'Cytosine or Thymine')]"

    "title": "Basics of Python Programming Language",
    "section": "Control Structures in Python",
    "text": "Control Structures in Python\nIn a program, control flow (or flow of control) refers to the order in which individual statements of the program are executed. Similarly, control flow in an algorithm is the order in which individual steps of the algorithm are executed.\nSo far, we have considered sequential control flow, i.e., statements getting executed from top to bottom, in the order they appear in the program. The sequential flow of control is the default behavior. However, we often need to alter this flow when we write programs, because the problems we can solve with sequential control flow alone are limited to simple (or, as one might say, trivial) problems. In other words, there are many problems that cannot be solved with the sequential control flow alone.\nMany problems that we encounter are complex enough that they require programs with enhanced control flows. For this, most programming languages provide at least three control structures for altering the default sequential flow. These control structures are known as selection, loop, and subprogram. Together with the default sequential flow, we have four control structures for specifying the control flow as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelection Control Structure\n\nif structure\nThe if structure in Python is similar to that of other languages. It contains an expression followed by a set of statements to be executed if the expression is evaluated as true.\nif expression:\n  statement_1\n  statement_2\n  ...\n  statement_n\nNote that, in Python, all statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a programming construct are considered to be part of a single block of code. Python uses indentation as its method of grouping statements.\n\n\nif ... else structure\nTo implement the selection control structure shown in subfigure (b) above with both blocks A and B specified, the else keyword can be combined with the if keyword. The else keyword is followed by the code that gets executed if the if-body does not get executed (i.e., conditional expression is not evaluated to true).\nThe else part is optional and there could be at most one else part following an if part. Further, an else part cannot exist alone; it must be paired with an if part.\nif expression:\n  statement(s)\nelse:\n  statement(s)\n\n\nMulti-way Selection with the elif Keyword\nThe elif keyword (meaning “else-if”) allows us to implement multi-way selection, going beyond the two-way selection in the if-else structure. This means, we can select one block of code for execution from among many (&gt; 2). For this, we need to specify multiple conditional expressions for truth value and execute a block of code as soon as the corresponding expression evaluates to true.\nAn elif part is optional and there can be an arbitrary number of elif parts following an if part.\nif expression_1:\n  statement(s)\nelif expression_2:\n  statement(s)  \nelif expression_3:\n  statement(s)  \n...\nelse:\n  statement(s)\nThe if...elif structure is a substitute for the “switch-case” structure in some other languages such as C.\n\n\n\nLoop Control Structure\nPython provides two loop structures: the for loop and the while loop. We can also have nested loops.\n\nThe for loop\nThe for loop construct is used to repeat a statement or block of statements specified number of times. The for loop can also iterate over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.\nfor iterating_var in sequence:\n   statements(s)\nThe block of statements executed repeatedly is called the loop body. The loop body is indented.\nIf the sequence contains an expression list, it is evaluated first. Then, the first item in the sequence is assigned to the iterating variable iterating_var and the loop body is executed. This concludes one iteration of the loop. Next the second iteration of the loop body is executed after the second item is assigned to the iterating variable iterating_var. Similarly, the loop body is executed repeatedly, with a unique item in the list assigned to iterating_var in each iteration, until the entire sequence is exhausted.\nThe range() function: If we do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function range() comes in handy. It generates lists containing arithmetic progressions. Implementation of range() is as either range(stop) or range(start, stop[, step]). Here are four examples.\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i, end=' ')\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n\n\n\nfor i in range(5, 10):\n    print(i, end=' ')\n\n5 6 7 8 9 \n\n\n\nfor i in range(0, 10, 3):\n    print(i, end=' ')\n\n0 3 6 9 \n\n\n\nfor i in range(-10, -100, -30):\n    print(i, end=' ')\n\n-10 -40 -70 \n\n\nTo iterate over the indices of a list or sequence using a for loop, you can combine range() and len() functions as follows:\n\nlist_a = ['John', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'puppy']\n# using range and len functions\nfor i in range(len(list_a)):\n  print(i, list_a[i])\n\n0 John\n1 had\n2 a\n3 little\n4 puppy\n\n\nOr using enumerate() function:\n\n# using enumerate function\nfor elem in enumerate(list_a):\n  print(elem)\n\n(0, 'John')\n(1, 'had')\n(2, 'a')\n(3, 'little')\n(4, 'puppy')\n\n\n\n\nThe while loop\nA while loop in Python repeatedly executes the loop body as long as a given condition is true. The condition is specified by an expression.\nwhile expression:\n  statement(s)\nThe block of statements executed repeatedly is the loop body, which is indented, as in the for loop.\nThe condition to execute the loop body is considered true if the expression is true or it is any non-zero value. The loop iterates while the condition is true. When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately following the loop body.\nNote that the while loop might not ever run. When the condition is tested and the result is false, the loop body will be skipped and the first statement after the while loop will be executed.\n\n\nThe break keyword\nThe break keyword is used inside a loop and is used for terminating the current iteration of the loop body immediately; i.e., to break out of the smallest enclosing for or while loop. The control will be transferred to the first statement following the loop body. If you are inside the inner loop of a nested loop, then the break statement inside that inner loop transfers the control to the immediate outer loop. The break statement can be used to terminate an infinite loop or to force a loop to end before its normal termination.\n\nn = 10;\nfor var in range(0, n):\n    print(var)\n    if (var == 5):\n        print(\"Countdown Aborted\")\n        break;\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nCountdown Aborted\n\n\n\n\nThe continue keyword\nThe continue keyword inside a loop causes the program to skip the rest of the loop body in the current iteration, causing it to continue with the next iteration of the loop.\n\nfor i in range(-2,3):\n  if i == 0 :\n      continue\n  print(\"5 divided by \", i, \" is: \", (5.0/i))\n\n5 divided by  -2  is:  -2.5\n5 divided by  -1  is:  -5.0\n5 divided by  1  is:  5.0\n5 divided by  2  is:  2.5"

    "text": "Basic data structures in pandas\nPandas provides two types of classes for handling data: Series and DataFrame.\n\nSeries\nSeries is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively referred to as the index. The basic method to create a Series is to call:\ns = pd.Series(data, index=index)\nHere, data can be a Python dict, an ndarray (a multidimensional container of items of the same type and size) or a scalar value. The passed index is a list of axis labels.\nTo open the help page for Series, you can use the following code:\n\nimport pandas as pd\nhelp(pd.Series)  \n# or help(pandas.Series)\n\n\n\n\nHelp on class Series in module pandas.core.series:\n\nclass Series(pandas.core.base.IndexOpsMixin, pandas.core.generic.NDFrame)\n |  Series(data=None, index=None, dtype: 'Dtype | None' = None, name=None, copy: 'bool | None' = None, fastpath: 'bool | lib.NoDefault' = &lt;no_default&gt;) -&gt; 'None'\n |  \n |  One-dimensional ndarray with axis labels (including time series).\n |  \n |  Labels need not be unique but must be a hashable type.

By using the options\n |      ``convert_string``, ``convert_integer``, ``convert_boolean`` and\n |      ``convert_floating``, it is possible to turn off individual conversions\n |      to ``StringDtype``, the integer extension types, ``BooleanDtype``\n |      or floating extension types, respectively.\n |      \n |      For object-dtyped columns, if ``infer_objects`` is ``True``, use the inference\n |      rules as during normal Series/DataFrame construction.  Then, if possible,\n |      convert to ``StringDtype``, ``BooleanDtype`` or an appropriate integer\n |      or floating extension type, otherwise leave as ``object``.\n |      \n |      If the dtype is integer, convert to an appropriate integer extension type.\n |      \n |      If the dtype is numeric, and consists of all integers, convert to an\n |      appropriate integer extension type. Otherwise, convert to an\n |      appropriate floating extension type.\n |      \n |      In the future, as new dtypes are added that support ``pd.NA``, the results\n |      of this method will change to support those new dtypes.\n |      \n |      Examples\n |      --------\n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; df = pd.DataFrame(\n |      ...     {\n |      ...         \"a\": pd.Series([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.dtype(\"int32\")),\n |      ...         \"b\": pd.Series([\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"], dtype=np.dtype(\"O\")),\n |      ...         \"c\": pd.Series([True, False, np.nan], dtype=np.dtype(\"O\")),\n |      ...         \"d\": pd.Series([\"h\", \"i\", np.nan], dtype=np.dtype(\"O\")),\n |      ...         \"e\": pd.Series([10, np.nan, 20], dtype=np.dtype(\"float\")),\n |      ...         \"f\": pd.Series([np.nan, 100.5, 200], dtype=np.dtype(\"float\")),\n |      ...     }\n |      ... )\n |      \n |      Start with a DataFrame with default dtypes.\n |      \n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; df\n |         a  b      c    d     e      f\n |      0  1  x   True    h  10.0    NaN\n |      1  2  y  False    i   NaN  100.5\n |      2  3  z    NaN  NaN  20.0  200.0\n |      \n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; df.dtypes\n |      a      int32\n |      b     object\n |      c     object\n |      d     object\n |      e    float64\n |      f    float64\n |      dtype: object\n |      \n |      Convert the DataFrame to use best possible dtypes.\n |      \n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; dfn = df.convert_dtypes()\n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; dfn\n |         a  b      c     d     e      f\n |      0  1  x   True     h    10   &lt;NA&gt;\n |      1  2  y  False     i  &lt;NA&gt;  100.5\n |      2  3  z   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;    20  200.0\n |      \n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; dfn.dtypes\n |      a             Int32\n |      b    string[python]\n |      c           boolean\n |      d    string[python]\n |      e             Int64\n |      f           Float64\n |      dtype: object\n |      \n |      Start with a Series of strings and missing data represented by ``np.nan``.\n |      \n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; s = pd.Series([\"a\", \"b\", np.nan])\n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; s\n |      0      a\n |      1      b\n |      2    NaN\n |      dtype: object\n |      \n |      Obtain a Series with dtype ``StringDtype``.\n |      \n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; s.convert_dtypes()\n |      0       a\n |      1       b\n |      2    &lt;NA&gt;\n |      dtype: string\n |  \n |  copy(self, deep: 'bool_t | None' = True) -&gt; 'Self'\n |      Make a copy of this object's indices and data.\n |      \n |      When ``deep=True`` (default), a new object will be created with a\n |      copy of the calling object's data and indices.

Timestamps also include the ``first`` and ``last`` items.\n |      \n |      If multiple object values have the highest count, then the\n |      ``count`` and ``top`` results will be arbitrarily chosen from\n |      among those with the highest count.\n |      \n |      For mixed data types provided via a ``DataFrame``, the default is to\n |      return only an analysis of numeric columns.

This doesn't matter much for `value` since there\n |                are only a few possible substitution regexes you can use.\n |              - str, regex and numeric rules apply as above.\n |      \n |          * dict:\n |      \n |              - Dicts can be used to specify different replacement values\n |                for different existing values. For example,\n |                ``{'a': 'b', 'y': 'z'}`` replaces the value 'a' with 'b' and\n |                'y' with 'z'. To use a dict in this way, the optional `value`\n |                parameter should not be given.\n |              - For a DataFrame a dict can specify that different values\n |                should be replaced in different columns. For example,\n |                ``{'a': 1, 'b': 'z'}`` looks for the value 1 in column 'a'\n |                and the value 'z' in column 'b' and replaces these values\n |                with whatever is specified in `value`. The `value` parameter\n |                should not be ``None`` in this case. You can treat this as a\n |                special case of passing two lists except that you are\n |                specifying the column to search in.\n |              - For a DataFrame nested dictionaries, e.g.,\n |                ``{'a': {'b': np.nan}}``, are read as follows: look in column\n |                'a' for the value 'b' and replace it with NaN. The optional `value`\n |                parameter should not be specified to use a nested dict in this\n |                way. You can nest regular expressions as well. Note that\n |                column names (the top-level dictionary keys in a nested\n |                dictionary) **cannot** be regular expressions.\n |      \n |          * None:\n |      \n |              - This means that the `regex` argument must be a string,\n |                compiled regular expression, or list, dict, ndarray or\n |                Series of such elements. If `value` is also ``None`` then\n |                this **must** be a nested dictionary or Series.\n |      \n |          See the examples section for examples of each of these.\n |      value : scalar, dict, list, str, regex, default None\n |          Value to replace any values matching `to_replace` with.\n |          For a DataFrame a dict of values can be used to specify which\n |          value to use for each column (columns not in the dict will not be\n |          filled).

If you have set a `float_format`\n |          then floats are converted to strings and thus csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC\n |          will treat them as non-numeric.\n |      quotechar : str, default '\\\"'\n |          String of length 1. Character used to quote fields.\n |      lineterminator : str, optional\n |          The newline character or character sequence to use in the output\n |          file. Defaults to `os.linesep`, which depends on the OS in which\n |          this method is called ('\\\\n' for linux, '\\\\r\\\\n' for Windows, i.e.).\n |      \n |          .. versionchanged:: 1.5.0\n |      \n |              Previously was line_terminator, changed for consistency with\n |              read_csv and the standard library 'csv' module.\n |      \n |      chunksize : int or None\n |          Rows to write at a time.\n |      date_format : str, default None\n |          Format string for datetime objects.\n |      doublequote : bool, default True\n |          Control quoting of `quotechar` inside a field.\n |      escapechar : str, default None\n |          String of length 1. Character used to escape `sep` and `quotechar`\n |          when appropriate.\n |      decimal : str, default '.'\n |          Character recognized as decimal separator. E.g. use ',' for\n |          European data.\n |      errors : str, default 'strict'\n |          Specifies how encoding and decoding errors are to be handled.\n |          See the errors argument for :func:`open` for a full list\n |          of options.\n |      \n |      storage_options : dict, optional\n |          Extra options that make sense for a particular storage connection, e.g.\n |          host, port, username, password, etc. For HTTP(S) URLs the key-value pairs\n |          are forwarded to ``urllib.request.Request`` as header options.

    "text": "DataFrame\nDataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or a dict of Series objects. The DataFrame is generally the most commonly used pandas object. It accepts many different types of input including dictionary of 1-D ndarrays, lists, dictionaries or Series, 2-D ndarray, a Series or even another DataFrame.\nAlong with the data, you can optionally pass index (row labels) and columns (column labels) arguments. If you pass an index and/or columns, you are guaranteeing the index and/or columns of the resulting DataFrame.\nThe basic method to create a DataFrame is to call:\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data, index=index, columns=columns)\nTo open the help page for DataFrame, you can use the following code:\n\nimport pandas as pd\nhelp(pd.DataFrame)  \n# or help(pandas.DataFrame)\n\n\n\n\nHelp on class DataFrame in module pandas.core.frame:\n\nclass DataFrame(pandas.core.generic.NDFrame, pandas.core.arraylike.OpsMixin)\n |  DataFrame(data=None, index: 'Axes | None' = None, columns: 'Axes | None' = None, dtype: 'Dtype | None' = None, copy: 'bool | None' = None) -&gt; 'None'\n |  \n |  Two-dimensional, size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data.\n |  \n |  Data structure also contains labeled axes (rows and columns).\n |  Arithmetic operations align on both row and column labels. Can be\n |  thought of as a dict-like container for Series objects. The primary\n |  pandas data structure.\n |  \n |  Parameters\n |  ----------\n |  data : ndarray (structured or homogeneous), Iterable, dict, or DataFrame\n |      Dict can contain Series, arrays, constants, dataclass or list-like objects. If\n |      data is a dict, column order follows insertion-order. If a dict contains Series\n |      which have an index defined, it is aligned by its index. This alignment also\n |      occurs if data is a Series or a DataFrame itself. Alignment is done on\n |      Series/DataFrame inputs.\n |  \n |      If data is a list of dicts, column order follows insertion-order.\n |  \n |  index : Index or array-like\n |      Index to use for resulting frame. Will default to RangeIndex if\n |      no indexing information part of input data and no index provided.\n |  columns : Index or array-like\n |      Column labels to use for resulting frame when data does not have them,\n |      defaulting to RangeIndex(0, 1, 2, ..., n). If data contains column labels,\n |      will perform column selection instead.\n |  dtype : dtype, default None\n |      Data type to force. Only a single dtype is allowed. If None, infer.\n |  copy : bool or None, default None\n |      Copy data from inputs.\n |      For dict data, the default of None behaves like ``copy=True``.  For DataFrame\n |      or 2d ndarray input, the default of None behaves like ``copy=False``.\n |      If data is a dict containing one or more Series (possibly of different dtypes),\n |      ``copy=False`` will ensure that these inputs are not copied.\n |  \n |      .. versionchanged:: 1.3.0\n |  \n |  See Also\n |  --------\n |  DataFrame.from_records : Constructor from tuples, also record arrays.\n |  DataFrame.from_dict : From dicts of Series, arrays, or dicts.\n |  read_csv : Read a comma-separated values (csv) file into DataFrame.\n |  read_table : Read general delimited file into DataFrame.\n |  read_clipboard : Read text from clipboard into DataFrame.\n |  \n |  Notes\n |  -----\n |  Please reference the :ref:`User Guide &lt;basics.dataframe&gt;` for more information.\n |  \n |  Examples\n |  --------\n |  Constructing DataFrame from a dictionary.\n |  \n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'col1': [1, 2], 'col2': [3, 4]}\n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; df = pd.DataFrame(data=d)\n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; df\n |     col1  col2\n |  0     1     3\n |  1     2     4\n |  \n |  Notice that the inferred dtype is int64.\n |  \n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; df.dtypes\n |  col1    int64\n |  col2    int64\n |  dtype: object\n |  \n |  To enforce a single dtype:\n |  \n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; df = pd.DataFrame(data=d, dtype=np.int8)\n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; df.dtypes\n |  col1    int8\n |  col2    int8\n |  dtype: object\n |  \n |  Constructing DataFrame from a dictionary including Series:\n |  \n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; d = {'col1': [0, 1, 2, 3], 'col2': pd.Series([2, 3], index=[2, 3])}\n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; pd.DataFrame(data=d, index=[0, 1, 2, 3])\n |     col1  col2\n |  0     0   NaN\n |  1     1   NaN\n |  2     2   2.0\n |  3     3   3.0\n |  \n |  Constructing DataFrame from numpy ndarray:\n |  \n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; df2 = pd.DataFrame(np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]),\n |  ...                    columns=['a', 'b', 'c'])\n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; df2\n |     a  b  c\n |  0  1  2  3\n |  1  4  5  6\n |  2  7  8  9\n |  \n |  Constructing DataFrame from a numpy ndarray that has labeled columns:\n |  \n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; data = np.array([(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9)],\n |  ...                 dtype=[(\"a\", \"i4\"), (\"b\", \"i4\"), (\"c\", \"i4\")])\n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; df3 = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['c', 'a'])\n |  ...\n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; df3\n |     c  a\n |  0  3  1\n |  1  6  4\n |  2  9  7\n |  \n |  Constructing DataFrame from dataclass:\n |  \n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; from dataclasses import make_dataclass\n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; Point = make_dataclass(\"Point\", [(\"x\", int), (\"y\", int)])\n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; pd.DataFrame([Point(0, 0), Point(0, 3), Point(2, 3)])\n |     x  y\n |  0  0  0\n |  1  0  3\n |  2  2  3\n |  \n |  Constructing DataFrame from Series/DataFrame:\n |  \n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; ser = pd.Series([1, 2, 3], index=[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"])\n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; df = pd.DataFrame(data=ser, index=[\"a\", \"c\"])\n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; df\n |     0\n |  a  1\n |  c  3\n |  \n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; df1 = pd.DataFrame([1, 2, 3], index=[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], columns=[\"x\"])\n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; df2 = pd.DataFrame(data=df1, index=[\"a\", \"c\"])\n |  &gt;&gt;&gt; df2\n |     x\n |  a  1\n |  c  3\n |  \n |  Method resolution order:\n |      DataFrame\n |      pandas.core.generic.NDFrame\n |      pandas.core.base.PandasObject\n |      pandas.core.accessor.DirNamesMixin\n |      pandas.core.indexing.IndexingMixin\n |      pandas.core.arraylike.OpsMixin\n |      builtins.object\n |  \n |  Methods defined here:\n |  \n |  __arrow_c_stream__(self, requested_schema=None)\n |      Export the pandas DataFrame as an Arrow C stream PyCapsule.\n |      \n |      This relies on pyarrow to convert the pandas DataFrame to the Arrow\n |      format (and follows the default behaviour of ``pyarrow.Table.from_pandas``\n |      in its handling of the index, i.e. store the index as a column except\n |      for RangeIndex).\n |      This conversion is not necessarily zero-copy.\n |      \n |      Parameters\n |      ----------\n |      requested_schema : PyCapsule, default None\n |          The schema to which the dataframe should be casted, passed as a\n |          PyCapsule containing a C ArrowSchema representation of the\n |          requested schema.\n |      \n |      Returns\n |      -------\n |      PyCapsule\n |  \n |  __dataframe__(self, nan_as_null: 'bool' = False, allow_copy: 'bool' = True) -&gt; 'DataFrameXchg'\n |      Return the dataframe interchange object implementing the interchange protocol.\n |      \n |      Parameters\n |      ----------\n |      nan_as_null : bool, default False\n |          `nan_as_null` is DEPRECATED and has no effect.

Because ``iterrows`` returns a Series for each row,\n |         it does **not** preserve dtypes across the rows (dtypes are\n |         preserved across columns for DataFrames).\n |      \n |         To preserve dtypes while iterating over the rows, it is better\n |         to use :meth:`itertuples` which returns namedtuples of the values\n |         and which is generally faster than ``iterrows``.\n |      \n |      2. You should **never modify** something you are iterating over.\n |         This is not guaranteed to work in all cases.

Please note that\n |      Python keywords may not be used as identifiers.\n |      \n |      For further details and examples see the ``query`` documentation in\n |      :ref:`indexing &lt;indexing.query&gt;`.\n |      \n |      *Backtick quoted variables*\n |      \n |      Backtick quoted variables are parsed as literal Python code and\n |      are converted internally to a Python valid identifier.\n |      This can lead to the following problems.\n |      \n |      During parsing a number of disallowed characters inside the backtick\n |      quoted string are replaced by strings that are allowed as a Python identifier.\n |      These characters include all operators in Python, the space character, the\n |      question mark, the exclamation mark, the dollar sign, and the euro sign.\n |      For other characters that fall outside the ASCII range (U+0001..U+007F)\n |      and those that are not further specified in PEP 3131,\n |      the query parser will raise an error.\n |      This excludes whitespace different than the space character,\n |      but also the hashtag (as it is used for comments) and the backtick\n |      itself (backtick can also not be escaped).\n |      \n |      In a special case, quotes that make a pair around a backtick can\n |      confuse the parser.\n |      For example, ```it's` &gt; `that's``` will raise an error,\n |      as it forms a quoted string (``'s &gt; `that'``) with a backtick inside.\n |      \n |      See also the Python documentation about lexical analysis\n |      (https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html)\n |      in combination with the source code in :mod:`pandas.core.computation.parsing`.\n |      \n |      Examples\n |      --------\n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; df = pd.DataFrame({'A': range(1, 6),\n |      ...

By using the options\n |      ``convert_string``, ``convert_integer``, ``convert_boolean`` and\n |      ``convert_floating``, it is possible to turn off individual conversions\n |      to ``StringDtype``, the integer extension types, ``BooleanDtype``\n |      or floating extension types, respectively.\n |      \n |      For object-dtyped columns, if ``infer_objects`` is ``True``, use the inference\n |      rules as during normal Series/DataFrame construction.  Then, if possible,\n |      convert to ``StringDtype``, ``BooleanDtype`` or an appropriate integer\n |      or floating extension type, otherwise leave as ``object``.\n |      \n |      If the dtype is integer, convert to an appropriate integer extension type.\n |      \n |      If the dtype is numeric, and consists of all integers, convert to an\n |      appropriate integer extension type. Otherwise, convert to an\n |      appropriate floating extension type.\n |      \n |      In the future, as new dtypes are added that support ``pd.NA``, the results\n |      of this method will change to support those new dtypes.\n |      \n |      Examples\n |      --------\n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; df = pd.DataFrame(\n |      ...     {\n |      ...         \"a\": pd.Series([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.dtype(\"int32\")),\n |      ...         \"b\": pd.Series([\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"], dtype=np.dtype(\"O\")),\n |      ...         \"c\": pd.Series([True, False, np.nan], dtype=np.dtype(\"O\")),\n |      ...         \"d\": pd.Series([\"h\", \"i\", np.nan], dtype=np.dtype(\"O\")),\n |      ...         \"e\": pd.Series([10, np.nan, 20], dtype=np.dtype(\"float\")),\n |      ...         \"f\": pd.Series([np.nan, 100.5, 200], dtype=np.dtype(\"float\")),\n |      ...     }\n |      ... )\n |      \n |      Start with a DataFrame with default dtypes.\n |      \n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; df\n |         a  b      c    d     e      f\n |      0  1  x   True    h  10.0    NaN\n |      1  2  y  False    i   NaN  100.5\n |      2  3  z    NaN  NaN  20.0  200.0\n |      \n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; df.dtypes\n |      a      int32\n |      b     object\n |      c     object\n |      d     object\n |      e    float64\n |      f    float64\n |      dtype: object\n |      \n |      Convert the DataFrame to use best possible dtypes.\n |      \n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; dfn = df.convert_dtypes()\n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; dfn\n |         a  b      c     d     e      f\n |      0  1  x   True     h    10   &lt;NA&gt;\n |      1  2  y  False     i  &lt;NA&gt;  100.5\n |      2  3  z   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;    20  200.0\n |      \n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; dfn.dtypes\n |      a             Int32\n |      b    string[python]\n |      c           boolean\n |      d    string[python]\n |      e             Int64\n |      f           Float64\n |      dtype: object\n |      \n |      Start with a Series of strings and missing data represented by ``np.nan``.\n |      \n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; s = pd.Series([\"a\", \"b\", np.nan])\n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; s\n |      0      a\n |      1      b\n |      2    NaN\n |      dtype: object\n |      \n |      Obtain a Series with dtype ``StringDtype``.\n |      \n |      &gt;&gt;&gt; s.convert_dtypes()\n |      0       a\n |      1       b\n |      2    &lt;NA&gt;\n |      dtype: string\n |  \n |  copy(self, deep: 'bool_t | None' = True) -&gt; 'Self'\n |      Make a copy of this object's indices and data.\n |      \n |      When ``deep=True`` (default), a new object will be created with a\n |      copy of the calling object's data and indices.

Timestamps also include the ``first`` and ``last`` items.\n |      \n |      If multiple object values have the highest count, then the\n |      ``count`` and ``top`` results will be arbitrarily chosen from\n |      among those with the highest count.\n |      \n |      For mixed data types provided via a ``DataFrame``, the default is to\n |      return only an analysis of numeric columns.

This doesn't matter much for `value` since there\n |                are only a few possible substitution regexes you can use.\n |              - str, regex and numeric rules apply as above.\n |      \n |          * dict:\n |      \n |              - Dicts can be used to specify different replacement values\n |                for different existing values. For example,\n |                ``{'a': 'b', 'y': 'z'}`` replaces the value 'a' with 'b' and\n |                'y' with 'z'. To use a dict in this way, the optional `value`\n |                parameter should not be given.\n |              - For a DataFrame a dict can specify that different values\n |                should be replaced in different columns. For example,\n |                ``{'a': 1, 'b': 'z'}`` looks for the value 1 in column 'a'\n |                and the value 'z' in column 'b' and replaces these values\n |                with whatever is specified in `value`. The `value` parameter\n |                should not be ``None`` in this case. You can treat this as a\n |                special case of passing two lists except that you are\n |                specifying the column to search in.\n |              - For a DataFrame nested dictionaries, e.g.,\n |                ``{'a': {'b': np.nan}}``, are read as follows: look in column\n |                'a' for the value 'b' and replace it with NaN. The optional `value`\n |                parameter should not be specified to use a nested dict in this\n |                way. You can nest regular expressions as well. Note that\n |                column names (the top-level dictionary keys in a nested\n |                dictionary) **cannot** be regular expressions.\n |      \n |          * None:\n |      \n |              - This means that the `regex` argument must be a string,\n |                compiled regular expression, or list, dict, ndarray or\n |                Series of such elements. If `value` is also ``None`` then\n |                this **must** be a nested dictionary or Series.\n |      \n |          See the examples section for examples of each of these.\n |      value : scalar, dict, list, str, regex, default None\n |          Value to replace any values matching `to_replace` with.\n |          For a DataFrame a dict of values can be used to specify which\n |          value to use for each column (columns not in the dict will not be\n |          filled).

However, in the real world, data will typically be provided by the users of our programs (which could include you!), and we often need to store the results of our analyses in a more permanent location than just printing them to the screen. During this session, we’ll explore a few commonly used methods for importing data into our programs by reading/writing files from disk using the pandas library.\nIt’s worth noting that there are numerous other ways to access data, such as querying a database or retrieving data from a network, such as the internet. While we won’t cover these methods in this session, Python offers excellent support for interacting with databases and networks, either through its standard library or via external modules.\n\nComma-Seperated Values (CSV) file or Text file\nRead a CSV or text file:\npd.read_csv(\"path_to_file.csv\")\n\n# read a text file with values separated by spaces\npd.read_csv(\"path_to_file.txt\", delimeter=' ')\nWrite a DataFrame df to a CSV or text file:\ndf.to_csv(\"path_to_file.csv\")\ndf.to_csv(\"path_to_file.txt\")\n\n\nExcel file\nRead an excel file:\npd.read_excel(\"path_to_file.xls\", sheet_name=\"Sheet1\")\npd.read_excel(\"path/to/file/name/file_name.csv\")\nWrite a DataFrame df to an excel file:\ndf.to_excel(\"path_to_file.xlsx\", sheet_name=\"Sheet1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nRead the CSV file associated with the Metabric dataset from this link into a Pandas DataFrame named metabric: “https://zenodo.org/record/6450144/files/metabric_clinical_and_expression_data.csv”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the Metabric dataset from the URL into a DataFrame\nmetabric = pd.read_csv(\"https://zenodo.org/record/6450144/files/metabric_clinical_and_expression_data.csv\")"

Below are some useful methods and how to access their help documentation.\nTo open the help page for any method in the DataFrame class, use the following code.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nhelp(pd.DataFrame.method_name)\n# or help(pandas.DataFrame.method_name)\n\nFor example, to open the help page for DataFrame.head():\n\nimport pandas as pd\nhelp(pd.DataFrame.head)  \n# or help(pandas.DataFrame.head)\n\n\n\n\nHelp on function head in module pandas.core.generic:\n\nhead(self, n: 'int' = 5) -&gt; 'Self'\n    Return the first `n` rows.\n    \n    This function returns the first `n` rows for the object based\n    on position. It is useful for quickly testing if your object\n    has the right type of data in it.\n    \n    For negative values of `n`, this function returns all rows except\n    the last `|n|` rows, equivalent to ``df[:n]``.\n    \n    If n is larger than the number of rows, this function returns all rows.\n    \n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    n : int, default 5\n        Number of rows to select.\n    \n    Returns\n    -------\n    same type as caller\n        The first `n` rows of the caller object.\n    \n    See Also\n    --------\n    DataFrame.tail: Returns the last `n` rows.\n    \n    Examples\n    --------\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; df = pd.DataFrame({'animal': ['alligator', 'bee', 'falcon', 'lion',\n    ...
